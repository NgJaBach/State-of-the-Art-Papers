Synopsis
Revascularization decisions in patients with diabetes and 
multivessel CAD are complex and are optimized via a 
Heart Team approach, with consideration of left ventricu-
lar function, patient preferences, symptoms, clinical pre-

B. Task: Surgical recommendation.
C. Answer:



Debug: Response

Given the patient's profile and the context provided, a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) with a left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery is recommended. This approach is preferred over percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients like John Smith, who have diabetes and multivessel coronary artery disease with LAD involvement, to reduce mortality and the need for repeat revascularizations.
