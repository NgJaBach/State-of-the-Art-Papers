COR LOE Recommendations
1 A
1. In patients with diabetes and multivessel CAD 
with the involvement of the LAD, who are 
appropriate candidates for CABG, CABG (with 
a LIMA to the LAD) is recommended in pref-
erence to PCI to reduce mortality and repeat 
revascularizations.1-8
2a B-NR
2. In patients with diabetes who have multivessel 
CAD amenable to PCI and an indication for 
revascularization and are poor candidates for 
surgery, PCI can be useful to reduce long-term 
ischemic outcomes.9,10
2b B-R
3. In patients with diabetes who have left main 
stenosis and low- or intermediate-complexity 
CAD in the rest of the coronary anatomy, PCI 
may be considered an alternative to CABG 
to reduce major adverse cardiovascular out-
comes.5,11
Synopsis
Revascularization decisions in patients with diabetes and 
multivessel CAD are complex and are optimized via a 
Heart Team approach, with consideration of left ventricu-
lar function, patient preferences, symptoms, clinical pre-
sentation, comorbidities, and expected survival.1,12-14 Dia-
betes is associated with 2- to 4-fold increased mortality 
risk from heart disease, and patients with diabetes have 
more aggressive atherosclerosis, more diffuse coronary 
lesions, smaller coronary vessels, and more extensive 
disease. After coronary revascularization, patients with 
diabetes experience a higher mortality rate and greater 
need for repeat revascularization procedures. 15 Clinical 
trials of patients with diabetes and multivessel CAD have 
demonstrated that PCI is associated with a higher mor-
tality rate at 5 years than that associated with CABG. 
The survival advantage of CABG becomes evident after 
2 years and attenuates after 8 years, as patients treat-
ed with CABG experience a late mortality catch-up. 2,16 
Of note, CABG is associated with an increased risk of 
stroke that persists up to 5 years. 17 The need for repeat 
revascularization is higher after PCI, regardless of the

bleeding or increased stroke risk in patients under-
going rescue PCI could be mitigated by using half-
dose tenecteplase in patients >75 years of age, 31 
by substituting radial access in place of femoral 
access,41 or by eliminating the routine use of plate-
let glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. With these tech-
niques, the reduced complications associated with 
PCI would provide a more favorable balance of risk

Debug: Response

Based on the patient's record and the reference, the surgical recommendation for John Smith, a 58-year-old male with diabetes and multivessel coronary artery disease with left anterior descending (LAD) involvement, is:

Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) with a Left Internal Mammary Artery (LIMA) to the LAD is recommended in preference to Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) to reduce mortality and repeat revascularizations.
