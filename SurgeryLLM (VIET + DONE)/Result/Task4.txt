Operative Notes:

Patient Name: John Smith
Medical Record Number: [Insert Record Number]
Date of Surgery: [Insert Date]
Surgeon: [Insert Surgeon’s Name]
Assistant Surgeon: [Insert Assistant’s Name]
Anesthesiologist: [Insert Anesthesiologist’s Name]
Preoperative Diagnosis: Diabetes with multivessel coronary artery disease involving the left anterior descending (LAD) artery
Postoperative Diagnosis: Same as preoperative
Procedure: Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) using Left Internal Mammary Artery (LIMA) to the LAD

Indications for Surgery:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of diabetes and multivessel coronary artery disease, with critical involvement of the LAD. Given his medical history and the involvement of LAD, he is an appropriate candidate for CABG, which is preferred over PCI to reduce mortality and the need for repeat revascularizations.

Anesthesia:
General endotracheal anesthesia was administered.

Findings:
Coronary angiography demonstrated significant multivessel disease with critical stenosis in the LAD. The left internal mammary artery (LIMA) was identified as suitable for grafting.

Procedure:
1. The patient was placed in the supine position, and standard sterile preparation was completed.
2. A median sternotomy was performed to gain access to the heart.
3. The LIMA was carefully dissected and prepared for grafting.
4. Cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated, and the heart was cooled to achieve cardioplegia.
5. The LIMA graft was successfully anastomosed to the LAD with running sutures.
6. Hemostasis was achieved, and the patient was weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass.
7. Chest tubes were placed, and the sternum was closed with wires.
8. The skin was closed in layers. The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Estimated Blood Loss: [Insert Amount in ml]
Specimens: [If applicable, otherwise state “None."]
Complications: [If any, otherwise state “None."]
Disposition:
The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition for further postoperative care.

Plan:
The patient will be monitored in the intensive care unit for hemodynamic stability, pain management, and wound care. Postoperative cardiac rehabilitation will be discussed following stabilization.
