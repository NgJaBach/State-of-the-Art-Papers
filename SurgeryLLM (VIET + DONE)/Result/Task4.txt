betes and multivessel coronary artery disease are 
optimized by the use of a Heart Team approach. 
Patients with diabetes who have triple-vessel dis-
ease should undergo surgical revascularization; 
percutaneous coronary intervention may be con-
sidered if they are poor candidates for surgery.
10. Treatment decisions for patients undergoing sur-
gical revascularization of coronary artery disease 
should include the calculation of a patient’s sur-
gical risk with the Society of Thoracic Surgeons 
score. The usefulness of the SYNTAX score calcu-
lation in treatment decisions is less clear because 
of the interobserver variability in its calculation and 
its absence of clinical variables.
PREAMBLE
Since 1980, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 
and American Heart Association (AHA) have translated 
scientific evidence into clinical practice guidelines with 
recommendations to improve cardiovascular health. 
These guidelines, which are based on systematic meth-
ods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a founda-
tion for the delivery of quality cardiovascular care. The 
ACC and AHA sponsor the development and publication 
of clinical practice guidelines without commercial sup-
port, and members volunteer their time to the writing and 
review efforts. Guidelines are official policy of the ACC 
and AHA. For some guidelines, the ACC and AHA part-
ner with other organizations.
Intended Use
Clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations 
applicable to patients with or at risk of developing 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). The focus is on medi-
cal practice in the United States, but these guidelines 
are relevant to patients throughout the world. Although 
guidelines may be used to inform regulatory or payer 
decisions, the intent is to improve quality of care and 
align with patients’ interests. Guidelines are intended 
to define practices meeting the needs of patients in 
most, but not all, circumstances and should not replace 
clinical judgment.

3. Task: Prepare sample operative notes.
4. Answer:



Debug: Response

To prepare a sample operative note for John Smith, we need to consider his medical history and the planned procedure. Based on the provided information, John Smith has diabetes and multivessel coronary artery disease with left anterior descending (LAD) involvement. 

Given the guidelines from the Lawton et al 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI Coronary Revascularization Guideline, for patients with diabetes and multivessel coronary artery disease, surgical revascularization (coronary artery bypass grafting, CABG) is often recommended. However, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may be considered if the patient is a poor candidate for surgery.

Here's a sample operative note for a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedure, assuming that's the chosen treatment plan:

**Sample Operative Note:**

**Patient Name:** John Smith  
**Date of Surgery:** [Insert Date]  
**Procedure:** Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)  
**Surgeon:** [Insert Surgeon's Name]  
**Anesthesia:** General Anesthesia  
**Assistant:** [Insert Assistant's Name]  

**Preoperative Diagnosis:** Multivessel coronary artery disease with left anterior descending (LAD) involvement, diabetes.

**Postoperative Diagnosis:** Same as preoperative diagnosis.

**Procedure Details:**
The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position. General anesthesia was induced, and the patient was intubated. The chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A median sternotomy was performed, and the pericardium was opened to expose the heart. The left internal mammary artery (LIMA) was harvested and used to bypass the LAD lesion. Saphenous vein grafts were used to bypass the other diseased coronary arteries. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established, and the heart was arrested with cardioplegia. The distal anastomoses were performed first, followed by the proximal anastomoses. The patient was weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass, and the heart resumed its normal function. The chest was closed in layers, and the patient was taken to the intensive care unit (ICU) in stable condition.

**Estimated Blood Loss:** [Insert amount]
**Fluids and Blood Products:** [List fluids and blood products administered]
**Urine Output:** [Insert amount]

**Complications:** None

**Condition at End of Procedure:** Stable
