DEFINE-FLAIR and the iFR-SWEDEHEART trials, 
rates of MACE in patients who had PCI deferred on 
the basis of an FFR >0.80 or an iFR >0.89 were 
4.05% and 4.12%, respectively, 10 with unplanned 
revascularization being the most frequent cause of 
MACE. The cutoffs of FFR and iFR provided were

4.4. Intravascular Ultrasound to Assess Lesion 
Severity
Recommendation for Intravascular Ultrasound to Assess Lesion Severity
Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized 
in Online Data Supplement 6.
COR LOE Recommendation
2a B-NR
1. In patients with intermediate stenosis of the left 
main artery, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is 
reasonable to help define lesion severity.1-5
Synopsis
IVUS can offer important anatomic information beyond what 
is seen on coronary angiography. IVUS is particularly use-
ful in lesions involving the left main artery where there may 
be limitations in coronary angiography due to overlapping 
vessels or foreshortening. IVUS offers significantly greater 
spatial resolution than angiography alone (IVUS axial reso-
lution is 100 to 150 μm, and coronary angiography axial 
resolution is 300 μm). Detailed cross-sectional images pro-
vide accurate evaluation of lesion characteristics, including 
lumen dimensions, lesion length, plaque morphology and 
location, thrombus, dissection, and stent apposition and ex-
pansion. Additionally, minimal lumen area on IVUS has been 
shown to correlate with physiological indices.6
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. In the case of indeterminate left main disease, 
studies have shown that IVUS evaluation with 
deferral of intervention for a minimum lumen area 
of ≥6 to 7 .5 mm2 is safe,1,2 although a smaller cut-
off (4.5–4.8 mm 2) may be more appropriate in

annular dilation, and decreased closing forces 
from reduced contractility.9–11 Because this LV dys-
function may be attributable to CAD and accom-
panying myocardial ischemia, the assessment of 
coronary anatomy status is necessary to complete 
the diagnosis and allow evaluation of revascular -
ization options.
3. Contrast-enhanced coronary CT angiography is 
an alternative to coronary angiography among 
selected patients who are at low to intermediate 
pretest probability of CAD before valve surgery.12 
This does not include patients who have active 
symptoms of angina, those with documented 
ischemia, or those with a prior history of CAD, 
all of whom should have selective coronary angi-
ography. Recent studies, most often in the set-
ting of a pre-TAVI evaluation, have demonstrated 
diagnostic sensitivity of >90%, specificity of 60% 
to 90%,13–15,21 and accuracy of >90%.21 Contrast-
enhanced coronary CT angiography may be safer 
than coronary angiography in selected patient 
populations, such as those with IE and vegeta-
tions on the aortic valve. However, a positive con-
trast-enhanced coronary CT angiogram, defined 
as the presence of epicardial CAD, requires con-
firmation with invasive coronary angiography 
to establish the need for and extent of CABG. 
The risk of radiation exposure and renal failure 
because of the contrast injection should be taken 
into consideration.
4. The presence of uncorrected CAD has been shown 
to negatively impact both perioperative 22,23 and 
late outcomes of surgery for VHD.19. Accordingly, 
concomitant CABG has been favored. These stud-
ies of concomitant CABG at the time of valve 
surgery have demonstrated little or no adverse 
impact on the acute perioperative mortality rate, 
despite increased cross-clamp and cardiopulmo-
nary bypass times. Moreover, combined CABG

3. Task: Identify unavailable preoperative tests.
4. Answer:



Debug: Response

Based on the patient record, the following preoperative tests are mentioned: 

1. Basic clinical assessment
2. Coronary angiography

However, other tests that might be considered preoperative tests are mentioned in the reference, such as:

1. Contrast-enhanced coronary CT angiography
2. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)
3. Fractional flow reserve (FFR)
4. Instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR)
5. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)

But, the patient record does not mention the results of the following tests:
 
1. Echocardiogram (to assess left ventricular function)
2. Stress test (to assess for inducible ischemia)
3. Cardiac MRI (to assess for myocardial viability)
4. Holter monitor (to assess for arrhythmias)

Therefore, the unavailable preoperative tests for John Smith are:

1. Echocardiogram
2. Stress test
3. Cardiac MRI
4. Holter monitor
5. Contrast-enhanced coronary CT angiography (not mentioned in the patient record)
6. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) (not mentioned in the patient record)
7. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) (not mentioned in the patient record)
8. Instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) (not mentioned in the patient record)
9. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) (not mentioned in the patient record)
