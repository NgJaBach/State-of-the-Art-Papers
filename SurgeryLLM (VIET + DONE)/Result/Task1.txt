Patient: John Smith
Age: 58, Male
Medical History: Diabetes; multivessel coronary artery disease with left anterior descending (LAD) involvement
Vital Signs: BP 140/85 mmHg, HR 80 bpm
Laboratory Findings: Hemoglobin 9.0 g/dL
Preoperative Workup: Basic clinical assessment, coronary angiography
 
B. Task: Check the record and identify results outside of reference ranges.
C. Answer:



Debug: Response

The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.0 g/dL, which is below the normal reference range for males (13.5–17.5 g/dL). Therefore, this is an abnormal laboratory finding. Additionally, the patient's blood pressure is 140/85 mmHg, which exceeds the guideline recommendation for a systolic blood pressure target of <130 mm Hg for patients with clinical cardiovascular disease.
