Age: 45, Female  
Medical History: Hypertension, Chronic kidney disease stage 2  
Vital Signs: BP 150/95 mmHg, HR 72 bpm  
Laboratory Findings:  
- Sodium (Na+): 150 mEq/L  
- Potassium (K+): 5.8 mEq/L  
- Bicarbonate (HCO3–): 18 mEq/L  
- Hemoglobin: 10.5 g/dL  
- Creatinine: 2.0 mg/dL  
Preoperative Workup: Renal function tests, Electrocardiogram  

Anomalies:  
- Sodium (Na+) is elevated, indicating possible hypernatremia.  
- Potassium (K+) is elevated, suggesting hyperkalemia.  
- Bicarbonate (HCO3–) is low, indicative of metabolic acidosis.  
- Hemoglobin is low, pointing towards anemia.  
- Creatinine is elevated, consistent with impaired kidney function (CKD progression).
