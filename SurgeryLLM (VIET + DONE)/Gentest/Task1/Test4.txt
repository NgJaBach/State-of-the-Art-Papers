**Record:**

Patient: Alice Johnson  
Age: 46, Female  
Medical History: Hypertension; Hyperlipidemia  
Vital Signs: BP 150/95 mmHg, HR 75 bpm  
Laboratory Findings:  
- Sodium: 148 mEq/L  
- Potassium: 3.0 mEq/L  
- Bicarbonate: 30 mEq/L  
- Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL  
- Glucose (Fasting): 110 mg/dL  
- LDL Cholesterol: 165 mg/dL  
- Platelet count: 410,000/mm3  
- Hemoglobin A1c: 7%  
- TSH: 5.5 μU/mL  

Preoperative Workup: Comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid profile  

**Anomalies:**  
- Sodium is elevated, above the normal range of 136–146 mEq/L (hypernatremia).  
- Potassium is decreased, below the normal range of 3.5–5.0 mEq/L (hypokalemia).  
- Bicarbonate is elevated, above the normal range of 22–28 mEq/L.  
- Creatinine is elevated, above the normal range of 0.6–1.2 mg/dL, indicating possible kidney function impairment.  
- Fasting glucose is slightly elevated, above the normal range of 70–100 mg/dL.  
- LDL Cholesterol is elevated, above the normal upper limit of <160 mg/dL.  
- Platelet count is slightly elevated, above the normal range of 150,000–400,000/mm3 (thrombocytosis).  
- Hemoglobin A1c is elevated, indicating poorly controlled blood sugar levels over time, above normal range of ≤6%.  
- TSH is elevated, above the normal range of 0.4–4.0 μU/mL, which may suggest hypothyroidism.
