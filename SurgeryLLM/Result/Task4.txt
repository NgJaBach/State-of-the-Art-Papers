Members were required to disclose all RWI relevant to 
the data under consideration.
1.3. Document Review and Approval
This document was reviewed by 2 official reviewers each 
nominated by the ACC and the AHA, as well as content 
reviewers nominated by the ACC and AHA. Reviewers’ 
RWI information was distributed to the writing commit-

1.4. Scope of the Guideline
The focus of this guideline is the diagnosis and man-
agement of adult patients with valvular heart disease 
(VHD). A full revision of the original 1998 VHD guide-
line was made in 2006, and an update was made in 
2008.1 Another full revision was made in 2014,2 with an 
update in 2017.3 There was an additional statement of 
clarification specifically for surgery for aortic dilation in 
patients with bicuspid aortic valves (BAV) in 2016.4 The 
present guideline will replace the 2014 guideline and 
2017 focused update. Some recommendations from 
the earlier VHD guidelines have been updated as war -
ranted by new evidence or a better understanding of

3. Task: Prepare sample operative notes.
4. Answer:



Debug: Response

To prepare a sample operative note for John Smith, who has diabetes and multivessel coronary artery disease with left anterior descending (LAD) involvement, we need to consider the guidelines provided by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) for coronary artery revascularization.

Given John Smith's condition, which includes multivessel coronary artery disease and diabetes, the ACC/AHA guidelines suggest that coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) may be preferred over percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for patients with complex disease, especially those with diabetes. However, the decision between CABG and PCI should be made based on individual patient characteristics, including the severity of symptoms, the extent and complexity of coronary artery disease, left ventricular function, and other comorbid conditions.

Here's a sample operative note for a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure, assuming that CABG is chosen as the treatment option for John Smith:

**Sample Operative Note:**

**Patient Name:** John Smith  
**Date of Procedure:** [Insert Date]  
**Procedure:** Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)  
**Surgeon:** [Insert Surgeon's Name]  
**Anesthesiologist:** [Insert Anesthesiologist's Name]  

**Preoperative Diagnosis:** Multivessel coronary artery disease with significant stenosis of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and diabetes mellitus.

**Postoperative Diagnosis:** Same as preoperative diagnosis.

**Procedure Details:**

The patient was taken to the operating room and placed under general anesthesia. The chest was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. A median sternotomy was performed to access the heart. The patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass, and the heart was arrested with cardioplegia to allow for a motionless field during the bypass grafting.

The left internal thoracic artery (LITA) was harvested and used to bypass the LAD lesion. Saphenous vein grafts were used to bypass the other significant coronary lesions. The grafts were anastomosed to the aorta and the respective coronary arteries using standard surgical techniques.

After completing the bypass grafts, the patient was weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass, and the heart resumed its normal function. The sternotomy was closed, and the chest was closed in layers. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in stable condition.

**Intraoperative Complications:** None.

**Estimated Blood Loss:** [Insert amount].

**Fluids and Blood Products:** [List any fluids or blood products administered during the procedure].

**Urine Output:** [Insert amount] during the procedure.

**Patient Status at End of Procedure:** Stable, transferred to ICU for postoperative care.

This sample operative note is a general template and should be modified according to the specific details of the patient's procedure and the surgeon's preferences. It's also important to note that the decision for CABG versus PCI should be individualized based on the patient's specific clinical scenario, including factors such as the extent of coronary disease, left ventricular function, and other comorbid conditions, in accordance with current guidelines and evidence-based practice.
