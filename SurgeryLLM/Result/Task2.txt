1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Methodology and Evidence Review
The recommendations listed in this guideline are, whenev-
er possible, evidence based. An initial extensive evidence 
review, which included literature derived from research in-
volving human subjects, published in English, and indexed 
in the US National Library of Medicine and the National 
Center for Biotechnology information (through PubMed), 
EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration, CINHL Complete, 
and other selected databases relevant to this guideline, 
was conducted from May 2019 to September 2019. Key 
search words included but were not limited to the follow-
ing: percutaneous coronary intervention, angioplasty, coro-
nary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, myocardial infarc-
tion, cardiac surgery, stent(s), angiogram, angiography, 
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary 
atherosclerosis, saphenous vein graft, internal mammary ar-
tery (IMA) graft, internal thoracic artery graft, arterial graft, 
post-bypass, non-ST elevated myocardial infarction, vein 
graft lesions, myocardial revascularization, multivessel PCI, 
and left ventricular dysfunction. Additional relevant studies, 
published through May 2021 during the guideline writing 
process, were also considered by the writing committee 
and added to the evidence tables when appropriate. The 
final evidence tables are included in the Online Data Sup-
plement and summarize the evidence used by the writing 
committee to formulate recommendations. References 
selected and published in the present document are rep-
resentative and not all-inclusive.

4. Answer:



Debug: Response

Based on the patient record provided, the following preoperative tests are mentioned:

1. Basic clinical assessment
2. Coronary angiography

However, other common preoperative tests such as:

1. Electrocardiogram (ECG)
2. Echocardiogram
3. Chest X-ray
4. Complete Blood Count (CBC)
5. Blood chemistry tests (e.g., creatinine, electrolytes)
6. Coagulation studies (e.g., PT, INR)

are not mentioned in the record. 

Therefore, the answer is: The record does not specify the results of the above-mentioned tests, so it is unclear if they were performed or not.
