events.1-3
Synopsis
Reducing cardiovascular events such as myocardial 
infarction and stroke, as well as preventing aneurysm 
growth and rupture, are the main goals in antihyper-
tensive therapy in AAA. Uncontrolled hypertension is a 
known risk factor for aortic rupture and dissection; there-
fore, achieving an SBP goal of <130 mm Hg, and a DBP 
goal of <80 mm Hg with the use of antihypertensive 
therapy in those with hypertension and AAA can reduce 
adverse clinical outcomes, and some patients may ben-
efit from more intensive lowering with an SBP goal of 
<120 mm Hg.4 The most robust evidence of antihyper-
tensive therapy in AAA is for beta blockers and agents 
that alter the renin angiotensin system; however, in pro-
spective clinical trials in humans, no specific agent has 
been proven to inhibit AAA growth.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

and AHA suggest all patients with clinical cardio-
vascular disease have a target SBP of <130 mm 
Hg and/or DBP <80 mm Hg. 1 Evidence supports

adverse events and all-cause mortality. 2,3 A more

via surveillance imaging and detection of aortic-related 
events and death. Intervention at diameters of <6.0 cm 
would reduce aortic-related events and death. There 
are also conditions in which intervention may be justi-
fied at smaller diameters (eg, rapid growth, symptoms, 
penetrating ulcers, mycotic aneurysms, connective tissue 
disorders). Concerns for operative death in the setting 
of comorbid conditions is certainly justified. However, in 
centers with a Multidisciplinary Aortic Team, excellent 
outcomes can be obtained despite the presence of such 
conditions, and fatal aortic events may thus be avoided.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Aortic event rates begin to rise significantly, and 
5-year survival begins to fall when TAAA diame-
ters are >6.0 cm. At this diameter, the risk of an 
adverse aortic event ranges from 9.3% 1 to 19%, 3 
which is 2 to 4 times the median operative mortal-
ity rate for open TAAA repair. In patients with mul-
tiple comorbidities known to substantially increase 
the risk of open TAAA repair (eg, chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease, advanced age, preopera-
tive renal dysfunction, preoperative left ventricular 
dysfunction), it may be appropriate to continue to 
observe patients with TAAA diameters >6.0 cm or 
to refer them for endovascular repair.
2. In centers with a Multidisciplinary Aortic Team, 
despite the presence of comorbid conditions, 
excellent outcomes can be achieved with meticu-
lous perioperative preparation and care as well as 
technically sound surgery. On multivariable analy-
sis, patients undergoing TAAA repair with a left 
ventricular ejection fraction <40% were not more 
prone to operative death (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.02–
4.14; P=0.58) or long-term death (OR, 0.55; 95% 
CI, 0.17–1.80; P=0.23) than those with higher

with duration of glucocorticoid treatment. 2 FDG-
PET has a reported specificity for GCA-related aor-
titis as high as 100% and CTA about 85%.5 In CT, 
wall thickening from inflammation may be mistaken 
for atherosclerosis; however, given CT’s usefulness 
in assessing occlusive lesions, intimal injury, ulcer-
ative plaques, and aneurysmal disease, it is often 
combined with FDG-PET in L VV.1 Evidence is limited 
for the role of MRI in GCA, but MRI is widely used 
in Takayasu arteritis given the patients’ younger age 
at diagnosis and need for lifelong surveillance imag-
ing.6 If proximal aortic involvement is confirmed by 
CT or MRI, then echocardiography may be helpful to 
assess aortic valve function.
2. Active vasculitis is diagnosed by clinical symp-
toms of GCA or Takayasu arteritis with evidence 
of inflammation by serum biomarkers, imaging, or 
both. High-dose glucocorticoid therapy (prednisone 
at 40–60 mg/d or equivalent) is standard induction 
therapy for GCA and Takayasu arteritis and leads 
to remission and control of active disease in most 
patients7-12 (Figures 25 and 26). Evidence support-
ing the efficacy of induction therapy with high-dose 
intravenous methylprednisolone in GCA comes 
only from small clinical trials, and thus the 2018 
recommendations from the European Alliance of 
Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR; formerly 
the European League Against Rheumatism) limits 
its use to patients with severe GCA at risk for blind-
ness in the acute setting, and administration should 
not delay oral glucocorticoid treatment. 7-9 Once 
the acute phase is controlled, glucocorticoid taper 
should be initiated to reach a target prednisone 
dose of 15 to 20 mg/d within 2 to 3 months, and 
≤5 mg/d for GCA and ≤10 mg/d for Takayasu arte-

scenario.18,19
3. Patients presenting with rAAA often maintain 
adequate BPs, in part because of the body’s cat-
echolamine responses. 20 However, once induced 
with general anesthesia, the loss of this physiologic 
response—coupled with anesthetic agents that can 
depress BP—can lead to circulatory collapse. 21-23 
General anesthesia has also been shown to have 
deleterious effects on inflammatory and body 
temperature regulation. 24,25 Subanalysis of the 
IMPROVE trial showed that patients with rAAA who 
underwent EVAR with only local anesthesia had 
lower risk of mortality compared with those who 
were treated under general anesthesia (adjusted 
OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.1–0.7). 7 Although the trial 
was not designed and powered for this specific 
outcome, recent observational studies from large 
registries have corroborated this finding.8,9
4. Although there are no RCTs of outcomes specific 
to permissive hypotension in rAAA, data from the 
trauma literature evaluating fluid management in 
hemorrhagic shock show benefit in using a strat-
egy of permissive hypotension. 11,12 Many authors 
managing rAAA have similarly described main-
taining low arterial pressures to decrease rate of 
bleeding in patients with rAAA. 1,3,10 An SBP that 
allows a patient to maintain mentation, typically 
between 60 and 90 mm Hg, is suggested.

4. Answer:



Debug: Response

Based on the patient record and the reference ranges provided, the following results are outside of the reference ranges:

1. Hemoglobin: 9.0 g/dL (reference range: 13.5-17.5 g/dL for males)
2. Blood Pressure: 140/85 mmHg (reference range for systolic blood pressure is not explicitly stated, but according to the text, the target SBP is <130 mmHg)

Note that the other laboratory values are not provided in the patient record, so it is not possible to determine if they are within or outside of the reference ranges.
