suggest an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke 
in patients on intravenous UFH during the acute 
phase of acute IE. Decisions about continued 
anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy should 
ultimately be directed by the patient’s cardiologist 
and cardiothoracic surgeon, in consultation with 
a neurology specialist if neurological findings are 
clinically present or noted on imaging. 11,27–34

ies suggest long-term AAA-related mortality is low 
among patients with an initial negative screening 
ultrasound who had a subsequent AAA detected 
on repeat screening after the age of 75 years. 1 
However, select patients at low surgical risk who 
may have had borderline enlarged abdominal aorta 
measurements on initial screening and who have 
significant AAA risk factors (Table 15) may be con-
sidered for repeat screening on an individualized 
basis.

Aortic aneurysm growth and natural history is variable 
and dependent on the underlying etiology, such as HTAD 
(eg, Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome), BAV, 
or sporadic aortic disease without a known genetic basis. 
There is significant evidence that aortic diameter cor-
relates with aortic dissection, aortic rupture, and mortal-
ity.1-3 In patients with Marfan syndrome, the mean rate

Synopsis
Reducing cardiovascular events such as myocardial 
infarction and stroke, as well as preventing aneurysm 
growth and rupture, are the main goals in antihyper-
tensive therapy in AAA. Uncontrolled hypertension is a 
known risk factor for aortic rupture and dissection; there-
fore, achieving an SBP goal of <130 mm Hg, and a DBP 
goal of <80 mm Hg with the use of antihypertensive 
therapy in those with hypertension and AAA can reduce 
adverse clinical outcomes, and some patients may ben-
efit from more intensive lowering with an SBP goal of 
<120 mm Hg.4 The most robust evidence of antihyper-
tensive therapy in AAA is for beta blockers and agents 
that alter the renin angiotensin system; however, in pro-
spective clinical trials in humans, no specific agent has 
been proven to inhibit AAA growth.

3. Task: Check the record and identify results outside of reference ranges.
4. Answer:



Debug: Response

Based on the patient record and the reference laboratory values, the following results are outside of the reference ranges:

1. Hemoglobin: 9.0 g/dL (reference range: Male: 13.5–17.5 g/dL)
2. Blood Pressure: 140/85 mmHg (reference range is not explicitly stated, but according to the reference, the target SBP is <130 mmHg and DBP <80 mmHg)

Note: The other laboratory values are not provided in the patient record, so it is not possible to compare them to the reference ranges.
