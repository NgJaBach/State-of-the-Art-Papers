Based on the provided laboratory results, here are the values outside of normal reference ranges:

1. **Hemoglobin (Hb):** 9.0 g/dL (Female) and 9.0 g/dL is on the border but is normal, for Male 13.5-17.5 g/dL, **Hemoglobin (Hb) is slightly below normal for Male (13.5-17.5 g/dL).**

2. **Immunoglobulins:**
   - IgA: 76–390 mg/dL (Near upper limit)
   - IgG: 650–1500 mg/dL (Elevated)
   - IgM: 50–300 mg/dL (Low)

3. **Gases, Arterial Blood:**
   - Po2: 75–105 mm Hg (Low)
   - pCO2: 33–45 mm Hg (Normal)
   - pH: 7.35–7.45 (Near lower limit)
   - (Please note that these slight abnormalities are commonly seen in various medical conditions.)

4. **Complete Blood Count (Hematologic):**
   - Hematocrit: 41%–53% (Male)
   - Hemoglobin, blood (Male): 9.0 g/dL (Low)
   - MCH: 25–35 pg/cell (Near lower limit)
   - MCHC: 31%–36% Hb/cell (Elevated)
   - Mean corpuscular hemoglobin change (MCHC): Near lower limit

5. **Other, Serum:**
   - Amylase: 25–125 U/L (Low)
   - Lipase: 13–60 U/L (Low)
   - Creatinine Clearance: 
     - Male: 97–137 mL/min (Lower limit)
     - Female: 88–128 mL/min (Lower limit)
   - Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 9.0 g/dL, (No units of reference value provided, likely mg/L)

6. **Lipids:**
   - Cholesterol (Male: Total >240 mg/dL, LDL <160 mg/dL)  (High and Low, respectively)

7. **Iron Studies:**
   - Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC): 250–400 µg/dL (Elevated)
   - Transferrin: 200–360 mg/dL (Normal)
   - Iron: 
     - Male: 65–175 µg/dL 
     - Female: 50–170 µg/dL

8. **Endocrine:**
   - None.

9. **Coagulation:**
   - Partial thromboplastin time (PTT/aPTT):
     - Activated: 25–40 seconds (Near upper limit)
   - D-dimer: ≤250 ng/mL (Normal)
