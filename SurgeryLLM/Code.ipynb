      "treatment of patients with significant coronary artery disease undergoing coronary revascularization as well as the supporting \n",

      "METHODS : A comprehensive literature search was conducted from May 2019 to September 2019, encompassing studies, \n",

      "STRUCTURE: Coronary artery disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Coronary revascularization \n",
      "is an important therapeutic option when managing patients with coronary artery disease. The 2021 coronary artery \n",
      "revascularization guideline provides recommendations based on contemporary evidence for the treatment of these patients. \n",
