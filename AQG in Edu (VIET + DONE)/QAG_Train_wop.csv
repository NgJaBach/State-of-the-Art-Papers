What is mantle plume and what is its role in plate tectonics?,"A mantle plume is an area under the rocky outer layer of Earth, called the crust, where magma is hotter than the surrounding magma. The heat from this extra hot magma causes melting and thinning of the rocky crust, which leads to widespread volcanic activity on Earth’s surface above the plume.Role of mantle plume in plate tectonics:When a plume head encounters the base of the lithosphere, it is expected to flatten out against this barrier and to undergo widespread decompression melting to form large volumes of basalt magma. It may then erupt onto the surface These eruptions have been linked to flood basalts.The eruption of continental flood basalts is often associated with continental rifting and breakup This has led to the hypothesis that mantle plumes contribute to continental rifting and the formation of ocean basins."

Is Yellowstone a mantle plume?,"Recently scientists have found evidence for a plume that is 350 km (about 220 mi) in diameter extending from the core-mantle boundary all the way to the base of the crust at Yellowstone. This new finding does not mean that Yellowstone is any more or less likely to erupt. Instead, it provides a clearer picture of the heat engine that drives the activity that we see at the surface, from geysers to earthquakes. But this result is far from the final word on the topic. Much more work is needed to confirm the existence of the plume and to understand the subtleties of how the plume relates to volcanism at the surface."
What type of volcano has basaltic lava?,"Shield volcanoes have basaltic lava. They are the largest of all the volcanoes on the earth. The Hawaiian volcanoes are the most famous examples.

What is the difference between a magma chamber and a mantle plume?,"Magma Chamber:Magma tends to be less dense than the layers of rock it forms in. As a result, it moves upward toward Earth’s surface via any path it can find. When it reaches an area where rock layers don’t allow an upward path, it will collect in a large pool that scientists call a magma chamber. Magma chambers are under such great pressure that, over time, they can eventually break the rock surrounding the chamber. When this happens, magma can find its way to the surface via a volcanic eruption.Mantle plume:A mantle plume is a vast column of superheated rock hundreds of miles below the earth surface. Mantle plumes may originate from the boundary between Earth’s mantle and core, nearly 3000 km (about 1850 mi) beneath the surface. They are suspected in several places around the planet, like Hawaii, the Galapagos, and Iceland."

What is slide in mass movement?,A slide happens when a section of soil or rock suddenly moves down a slope. The material moves as a single mass along a slippery zone. The slippery zone is often made up of wet sediment. 
What is the difference between mass movement and erosion?,"Mass movement:Mass movement is the movement of masses of bodies of mud, bedrock, soil, and rock debris, which commonly happen along steep-sided hills and mountains because of the gravitational pull. That means, air, water or ice do not carry debris with them from place to place but on the other hand, the debris may carry with it air, water or ice.Erosion:Erosion involves the acquisition and transportation of rock debris. When massive rocks break into smaller fragments through weathering and any other process, erosional geomorphic agents like running water, groundwater, glaciers, wind and waves remove and transport it to other places depending upon the dynamics of each of these agents."
What is weathering and mass movement?,"Weathering:Weathering is defined as the mechanical disintegration and chemical decomposition of rocks through the actions of various elements of weather and climate. There are a number of processes within weathering that act either individually or together to affect the earth materials in order to reduce them to fragmental state. There are three major groups of weathering processes : (i) chemical; (ii) physical or mechanical; (iii) biological weathering processes.Mass movement:Mass movement is the movement of masses of bodies of mud, bedrock, soil, and rock debris, which commonly happen along steep-sided hills and mountains because of the gravitational pull. That means, air, water or ice do not carry debris with them from place to place but on the other hand, the debris may carry with it air, water or ice."
What are the types of physical weathering?,"Unloading and Expansion: Removal of overlying rock load because of continued erosion causes vertical pressure release with the result that the upper layers of the rock expand producing disintegration of rock masses. Fractures will develop roughly parallel to the ground surface. In areas of curved ground surface, arched fractures tend to produce massive sheets or exfoliation slabs of rock.Temperature Changes and Expansion: With rise in temperature, every mineral expands and pushes against its neighbour and as temperature falls, a corresponding contraction takes place. Because of diurnal changes in the temperatures, this internal movement among the mineral grains of the superficial layers of rocks takes place regularly. This process is most effective in dry climates and high elevations where diurnal temperature changes are drastic. The surface layers of the rocks tend to expand more than the rock at depth and this leads to the formation of stress within the rock resulting in heaving and fracturing parallel to the surface. Due to differential heating and resulting expansion and contraction of surface layers and their subsequent exfoliation from the surface results in smooth rounded surfaces in rocks.Freezing, Thawing and Frost Wedging: Frost weathering occurs due to growth of ice within pores and cracks of rocks during repeated cycles of freezing and melting. Rapid freezing of water causes its sudden expansion and high pressure. The resulting expansion affects joints, cracks and small inter granular fractures to become wider and wider till the rock breaks apart.Salt Weathering: Salts in rocks expand due to thermal action, hydration and crystallisation. Salt crystals in near-surface pores cause splitting of individual grains within rocks, which eventually fall off. This process of falling off of individual grains may result in granular disintegration or granular foliation."
Do temperate cyclones bring rainfall?,"Yes, temperate cyclones cause rainfall over the Northern plains and snowfall in the mountains in the months of December and January. They are very important for the cultivation of ‘rabi’ crops."
What is a temperate zone?,The temperate zone lies between 23.5 degrees and 66.5 degrees in the north and south hemispheres. The North Temperate Zone is situated between the Arctic Circle and the Tropic of Cancer. The South Temperate Zone is situated between the Antarctic Circle and the Tropic of Capricorn. 
What are the steps of the hydrologic cycle?,"Evaporation: Evaporation is the primary pathway that water moves from the liquid state back into the water cycle as atmospheric water vapour. Condensation: Condensation is the change of the state of matter from the gas phase into the liquid phase, and is the reverse of vaporization.Precipitation: precipitation is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapour that falls under gravitational pull from clouds.Interception: Interception refers to precipitation that does not reach the soil, but is instead intercepted by the leaves, branches of plants and the forest floor.Infiltration: Infiltration happens when water soaks into the soil from the ground level. It moves underground and moves between the soil and rocks.Percolation: Percolation is the process of a liquid slowly passing through a filter.Transpiration: Transpiration is the process of water movement through a plant and its evaporation from aerial parts, such as leaves, stems and flowers.Runoff: Runoff occurs when there is more water than land can absorb. The excess liquid flows across the surface of the land and into nearby creeks, streams, or ponds.Storage: Storage is where water in the system resides or rests as it moves from one water reservoir to another."
What is hydrological cycle?,The hydrological cycle is the sum total of all processes in which water moves from the land and ocean surface to the atmosphere and back in form of precipitation.It is also known as the water cycle. The following are the important steps of the hydrologic cycle.
What is hydrologic cycle and what are its processes?,"Evaporation: Evaporation is the primary pathway that water moves from the liquid state back into the water cycle as atmospheric water vapour.

The excess liquid flows across the surface of the land and into nearby creeks, streams, or ponds.Storage: Storage is where water in the system resides or rests as it moves from one water reservoir to another."
Why hydrological cycle is important?,"Importance of hydrological cycle:It enables the availability of water for all living organisms and regulates weather patterns on our planet.As water undergoes infiltration, the ground purifies it of pollutants and contaminants.The water cycle continually feeds freshwater to all life on the planet.Rainfall and surface runoff play important roles in the cycling of various elements, also known as the biogeochemical cycle.The water cycle is powered by solar energy, and 86% of the global evaporation occurs from the oceans, reducing their temperature by evaporative cooling."
What are the types of mass movements?,"Slow movements: The movement of materials is extremely slow and imperceptible except through extended observation. Materials involved can be soil or rock debris.Rapid movements: Movement of water-saturated clayey or silty earth materials down low-angle terraces or hillsides is known as earthflow. When slopes are steeper, even the bedrock especially of soft sedimentary rocks like shale or deeply weathered igneous rock may slide downslope. Another type in this category is mudflow. In the absence of vegetation cover and with heavy rainfall, thick layers of weathered materials get saturated with water and either slowly or rapidly flow down along definite channels. A third type is the debris avalanche, which is more characteristic of humid regions with or without vegetation cover and occurs in narrow tracks on steep slopes. This debris avalanche can be much faster than the mudflow. Debris avalanche is similar to snow avalanche."
What is mass movement?,"Mass movement is the movement of masses of bodies of mud, bedrock, soil, and rock debris, which commonly happen along steep-sided hills and mountains because of the gravitational pull. That means, air, water or ice do not carry debris with them from place to place but on the other hand, the debris may carry with it air, water or ice. The movements of mass may range from slow to rapid, affecting shallow to deep columns of materials and include creep, flow, slide and fall.Mass movements do not come under erosion though there is a shift (aided by gravity) of materials from one place to another. Weak unconsolidated materials, thinly bedded rocks, faults, steeply dipping beds, vertical cliffs or steep slopes, abundant precipitation and torrential rains and scarcity of vegetation etc., favour mass movements."
What is a mass movement? Give example.,"Mass movement is the movement of masses of bodies of mud, bedrock, soil, and rock debris, which commonly happen along steep-sided hills and mountains because of the gravitational pull. That means, air, water or ice do not carry debris with them from place to place but on the other hand, the debris may carry with it air, water or ice.Examples of mass movements:In Andes mountains of South America and the Rockies mountains of North America, there are a few volcanoes that erupted during the last decade and very devastating mudflows occurred down their slopes during eruption as well as after eruption."
What are the processes of chemical weathering?,"Solution: On coming in contact with water many solids disintegrate and mix up as suspension in water. Soluble rock forming minerals like nitrates, sulphates, and potassium etc. are affected by this process. So, these minerals are easily leached out without leaving any residue in rainy climates and accumulate in dry regions.Carbonation: Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and soil air is absorbed by water, to form carbonic acid that acts as a weak acid. Calcium carbonates and magnesium carbonates are dissolved in carbonic acid and are removed in a solution without leaving any residue resulting in cave formation.Hydration: Minerals take up water and expand; this expansion causes an increase in the volume of the material itself or rock. Calcium sulphate takes in water and turns to gypsum, which is more unstable than calcium sulphate. This process is reversible and long, continued repetition of this process causes fatigue in the rocks and may lead to their disintegration.Oxidation: In the process of oxidation rock breakdown occurs due to the disturbance caused by the addition of oxygen.Reduction: When oxidised minerals are placed in an environment where oxygen is absent, reduction takes place. Such conditions exist usually below the water table, in areas of stagnant water and waterlogged ground. The red colour of iron upon reduction turns to greenish or bluish grey."
What are the agents of chemical weathering?,"Oxygen, surface and/or soil water and other acids are the agents of chemical weathering. Water and air (oxygen and carbon dioxide) along with heat must be present to speed up all chemical reactions. Over and above the carbon dioxide present in the air, decomposition of plants and animals increases the quantity of carbon dioxide underground. These chemical reactions on various minerals are very much similar to the chemical reactions in a laboratory."
What are the types of weathering?,"Weathering is defined as mechanical disintegration and chemical decomposition of rocks through the actions of various elements of weather and climate.There are three major groups of weathering processes :Chemical;Physical or mechanical;Biological weathering processes.Very rarely does any one of these processes ever operate completely by itself, but quite often a dominance of one process can be seen."
What is the difference between mechanical weathering and chemical weathering?,"Mechanical weathering or Physical Weathering:Physical or mechanical weathering processes depend on some applied forces. The applied forces could be: Gravitational forces such as overburden pressure, load and shearing stress;Expansion forces due to temperature changes, crystal growth or animal activity;Water pressures are controlled by wetting and drying cycles.Many of these forces are applied both at the surface and within different earth materials leading to rock fracture. Most of the physical weathering processes are caused by thermal expansion and pressure release. These processes are small and slow but can cause great damage to the rocks because of continued fatigue the rocks suffer due to repetition of contraction and expansion.Chemical Weathering:Chemical weathering is the weakening and subsequent breakdown of rocks by chemical reactions. A group of weathering processes viz; solution, carbonation, hydration, oxidation and reduction act on the rocks to decompose, dissolve or reduce them to a fine clastic state through chemical reactions by oxygen, surface and/or soil water and other acids. Water and air (oxygen and carbon dioxide) along with heat must be present to speed up all chemical reactions. Over and above the carbon dioxide present in the air, the decomposition of plants and animals increases the quantity of carbon dioxide underground. These chemical reactions on various minerals are very much similar to the chemical reactions in a laboratory."
What are the examples of chemical and mechanical weathering?,"Examples of chemical weathering:Minerals like calcium carbonate and calcium magnesium bicarbonate present in limestones are soluble in water containing carbonic acid (formed with the addition of carbon dioxide in water) and are carried away in the water as a solution.Calcium carbonates and magnesium carbonates are dissolved in carbonic acid and are removed in a solution without leaving any residue resulting in cave formation.Calcium sulphate takes in water and turns to gypsum, which is more unstable than calcium sulphate. This process is reversible and long, continued repetition of this process causes fatigue in the rocks and may lead to their disintegration.Examples of mechanical weathering:Rapid freezing of water causes its sudden expansion and high pressure. The resulting expansion affects joints, cracks and small intergranular fractures to become wider and wider till the rock breaks apart.Due to differential heating and resulting expansion and contraction of surface layers and their subsequent exfoliation from the surface results in smooth rounded surfaces in rocks. In rocks like granites, smooth surfaced and rounded small to big boulders called tors form due to such exfoliation."
How do temperate cyclones influence the climate of India?,Temperate cyclones enter India from the Mediterranean Sea in the winter season. These cause rainfall over the Northern plains and snowfall in the mountains in the months of December and January. They are very important for the cultivation of ‘rabi’ crops.
Which is the second longest non-polar glacier in the world?,"Siachen Glacier is the second longest glacier in the World’s Non-Polar areas. It is 78km long and the source for the Nubra River that waters the Nubra Valley near Leh in the Trans Himalayas.The Siachen Glacier is part of Ladakh, which has now been converted into a Union Territory. It is located in the eastern Karakoram range in the Himalayan mountains. It lies to the south of the great drainage divide that separates the Eurasian Plate from the Indian subcontinent in the glaciated portion of the Karakoram. Hence, it is also called the “Third Pole”."
Why is the location of Siachen so critical?,"The Siachen Glacier is part of Ladakh, which has now been converted into a Union Territory.It is located in the eastern Karakoram range in the Himalayan mountains. The Siachen Glacier lies to the south of the great drainage divide that separates the Eurasian Plate from the Indian subcontinent in the glaciated portion of the Karakoram. Hence, it is also called the “Third Pole”.It is located at a height of around 5700 m above sea level. Winds at this height can cross the 100 mph limit in no time, leading to a drop in temperature below -60 degrees. It is not just the harsh weather, but the non-availability of many basic amenities that makes life tougher up there. Staying for long in these climatic conditions might eventually lead to numerous health issues."
What is the role of respiration in the oxygen cycle?,The role of respiration in the oxygen cycle is to maintain carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in the atmosphere. Animals release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere which is then taken up by the plants to carry out photosynthesis. The plants release oxygen which is used up by human beings in respiration to produce carbon dioxide for plants again and this cycle goes on.
What are carbon and oxygen cycles?,The carbon cycle is mainly the conversion of carbon dioxide. This conversion is initiated by the fixation of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. The oxygen cycle is the biogeochemical cycle of oxygen. It is mainly involved in maintaining the level of oxygen in the atmosphere. 
What is polar vortex?,"The polar vortex is a large area of low pressure and cold air surrounding both of the Earth’s poles. The polar vortex contains some of the coldest air on Earth. The air is often contained by a strong jet of west-to-east moving winds that act like a wall, containing the cold air. These winds move at more than 161 kilometres per hour, which help lock the air into the place. "
In which state is the Siachen glacier located?,"The Siachen Glacier is part of Ladakh, which has now been converted into a Union Territory. It is located in the eastern Karakoram range in the Himalayan mountains. It lies to the south of the great drainage divide that separates the Eurasian Plate from the Indian subcontinent in the glaciated portion of the Karakoram. Hence, it is also called the “Third Pole”."
Is Siachen the longest glacier in India? ,"Yes, Siachen is the longest glacier in India. It is 78km long and the source for the Nubra River that waters the Nubra Valley near Leh in the Trans Himalayas. It is the Second-Longest glacier in the World’s Non-Polar areas.Siachen assumes strategic significance for India, Pakistan and even China because it forms a hub between Shaksgam Valley, Karakoram Pass and Aksai Chin. Therefore, holding Siachen is vital for India to prevent ingress not only from Pakistan but also from China. The point NJ9842 is the point where LOC between India and Pakistan ends. This point lies southwest of the Siachen glacier."

What are the stages of the nitrogen cycle?,"Nitrogen fixation: The process of conversion of nitrogen (N2 ) to ammonia is termed nitrogen fixation. Normally, bacteria change nitrogen into ammonium.Nitrification: Ammonia is first oxidised to nitrite by the bacteria Nitrosomonas and/or Nitrococcus. The nitrite is further oxidised to nitrate with the help of the bacterium Nitrobacter. These steps are called nitrification.Assimilation: Plants absorb nitrates from the soil into their roots. Then nitrogen gets used in chlorophyll, nucleic acids, and amino acids.Ammonification: When a plant or animal expires, decomposers such that bacteria and fungi turn the nitrogen back into ammonium.De-nitrification:It is the microbial process of reducing nitrate and nitrite to gaseous forms of nitrogen, principally nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitrogen (N2)."
What is nitrogen cycle? ,"The process of conversion of nitrogen (N2 ) to ammonia is termed nitrogen fixation. In nature, lightning and ultraviolet radiation provide enough energy to convert nitrogen to nitrogen oxides (NO, NO2, N2O).Industrial combustions, forest fires, automobile exhausts and power-generating stations are also sources of atmospheric nitrogen oxides. "
What is the importance of nitrogen cycle?,"Nitrogen Cycle helps the plants in synthesising chlorophyll from the compounds of nitrogen.Nitrogen is abundant in the atmosphere, but it is unusable to plants or animals unless it is converted into nitrogen compounds.Nitrogen-fixing bacteria play a crucial role in fixing the atmospheric nitrogen into nitrogen compounds that can be used by plants.The plants absorb the usable nitrogen compounds from the soil through their roots. Then, these nitrogen compounds are used for the production of proteins and other compounds in the cell.Animals assimilate nitrogen by consuming these plants or other animals that contain nitrogen. Humans consume proteins from these plants and animals and then, the nitrogen assimilates into our system."
What is the last stage of the nitrogen cycle?,"Denitrification is the last stage of the nitrogen cycle. Nitrate present in the soil is also reduced to nitrogen by the process of denitrification. This process is carried out by the denitrifying bacterial species- Clostridium and Pseudomonas, which will process nitrate to gain oxygen and gives out free nitrogen gas as a byproduct."
What is the role of decomposers in the nitrogen cycle?,"Decomposers break apart complex organic materials into more elementary substances. The decomposers, namely bacteria or fungi present in the soil, convert the organic matter back into ammonium. "
What is the oxygen cycle and why is it important?,"The oxygen cycle is a biological process which helps in maintaining the oxygen level by moving through three main spheres of the earth which are:Atmosphere,Lithosphere,Biosphere,The oxygen cycle is interconnected with the carbon cycle.It is an essential biogeochemical cycle that maintains the concentration and level of oxygen.Oxygen is an important element required for life, however, it can be toxic to some anaerobic bacteria."
Where does oxygen come from?,"Oxygen is the main by-product of photosynthesis. It is involved in the oxidation of carbohydrates with the release of energy, carbon dioxide and water.But when we talk of the oxygen cycle, we are mainly referring to the cycle that maintains the levels of oxygen in the atmosphere. Oxygen from the atmosphere is used up in three processes, namely combustion, respiration and the formation of oxides of nitrogen. Oxygen is returned to the atmosphere in only one major process, that is, photosynthesis. And this forms the broad outline of the oxygen cycle in nature."
Why is oxygen important for life?,"Oxygen is an important element required for life. The oxygen cycle begins with the process of photosynthesis in the presence of sunlight, releases oxygen back into the atmosphere, which humans and animals breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide, and again linking back to the plants.however, it can be toxic to some anaerobic bacteria."
What is rock cycle?,Rocks do not remain in their original form for long but may undergo transformation. The Rock cycle is a continuous process through which old rocks are transformed into new ones. when the molten magma cools; it solidifies to become igneous rock. These igneous rocks are broken down into small particles that are transported and deposited to form sedimentary rocks. When the igneous and sedimentary rocks are subjected to heat and pressure they change into metamorphic rocks. The metamorphic rocks which are still under great heat and pressure melt down to form molten magma. This molten magma again can cool down and solidify into igneous rocks.
What are the key processes of rock cycle?,"Crystallization:As the magma cools, different crystals form at different temperatures, undergoing crystallization.Erosion and sedimentation:Erosion is the process of carrying away or displacement of sediment by the action of wind, water, gravity, or ice. The process of deposition of sediment from a state of suspension or solution in a fluid is called sedimentation.Metamorphism: Metamorphism occurs when rocks are forced down to lower levels by tectonic processes or when molten magma rising through the crust comes in contact with the crustal rocks or the underlying rocks are subjected to great amounts of pressure by overlying rocks. It is a process by which already consolidated rocks undergo recrystallisation and reorganisation of materials within original rocks."
What are the main types of sedimentary rocks?,"Clastic sedimentary rocks: Formed from clasts or pieces of other rock. (Eg: sandstone),Organic sedimentary rocks: Formed from hard, biological materials like plants, shells, and bones that are compressed into rock. (Eg: coal),Chemical sedimentary rocks: Formed from chemical precipitation. (Eg: limestone, halite, and flint)"
How many rock types are there?,"There are many different kinds of rocks that are grouped under three families on the basis of their mode of formation. They are: Igneous Rocks: solidified from magma and lava; ,Sedimentary Rocks: the result of deposition of fragments of rocks by exogenous processes; Metamorphic Rocks: formed out of existing rocks undergoing recrystallisation."
What is the rock cycle order?,Igneous Rocks-when the molten magma cools; it solidifies to become igneous rock.Sedimentary Rocks- igneous rocks are broken down into small particles that are transported and deposited to form sedimentary rocks.Metamorphic Rocks-  igneous and sedimentary rocks are subjected to heat and pressure they change into metamorphic rocks.
What happens during a polar vortex?,"The polar vortex is the name given to the counterclockwise flow of air that occurs over the polar regions of a planet. On Earth, the vortex becomes less stable during winter, sending polar air away from the poles.Occasionally, changes in air pressure and wind help to diminish the “wall” of air containing the polar vortex, causing wobbles within the vortex. This unleashes cold air from the poles, allowing it to spread to other regions. This results in temperatures plummeting below -18°C (0°F) in major cities. In the United States, the weakened vortex can cause bitterly cold temperatures to reach as far south as Florida. The Antarctic’s polar vortex is stronger than its northern counterpart and not as susceptible to these wobbles."
How is pediplain formed?,"Pediplain is a broad and relatively flat rock surface formed by the joining of several pediments. As water and wind slowly erode and disintegrate rock surfaces, they reduce mountain ranges into a series of pediments at the base, and these pediments gently slope outward, where they coalesce with each other to form one large plain, which is the pediplain. Pediments are best formed in arid and semi-arid areas where rainfall is intense for brief moments of time."
What is a V-shaped valley?,"V-shaped valleys are carved out by the river in their youthful stages. They are formed by the erosional actions of the rivers. Their shapes are of the letter of the English alphabet V. They are associated with gorges, canyons etc. "
What is the importance of plate tectonic theory?,"Plate tectonic theory revolutionized Earth sciences by providing a uniform context for understanding mountain-building processes, volcanoes, and earthquakes as well as the evolution of Earth’s surface and reconstructing its past continents and oceans."
What are the different types of exogenic processes?,"All the exogenic geomorphic processes are covered under the general term, denudation. The word ‘denude’ means to strip off or to uncover. Different types of exogenic processes are weathering, mass wasting/movements, erosion and transportation.Weathering:Weathering is the breaking down or dissolving of rocks and minerals on Earths surface,Mass wasting:Mass wasting is the movement of rock and soil downslope under the influence of gravity.Erosion:The geological process in which earthen materials are worn away and transported by natural forces such as wind or water.Transportation: Transportation is the movement of material across the Earth’s surface by water, wind, ice or gravity."
What is the present largest national park in India?,Hemis National Park is the largest National park in India covering an area of 4400 square Km.
What is pelagic deposit?,"Pelagic deposits consist of organic material in the form of marine plants and animals as well as inorganic material. They are generally found in the deep oceans in the continental slope, continental rise, trenches, and abyssal plains. Pelagic deposits cover about 75% of ocean areas in the form of many types of oozes in a sporadic mix in most cases with other types of ocean deposits."
What are the two types of oozes?,Ooze contains both organic sediments from marines remains and inorganic sediments from muds. The ooze is further classified into two types. They are:Calcareous Ooze: It is made up of Calcium carbonate made up of marine Mollusca and single-cell Protozoans.Siliceous Ooze: It is also of organic origin made up of silica; mostly found in Phytoplankton and diatom.
What is the meaning of terrigenous deposits?,"Terrigenous deposits are deposits of mud, sand, gravel, and volcanic materials, derived from the denudation of continental rocks. The main sources of Terrigenous deposits are terrestrial sediments. They are mainly found on the Continental shelf."
What is humidity?,Water vapour present in the air is known as humidity. It is expressed quantitatively in different ways. The actual amount of water vapour present in the atmosphere is known as absolute humidity. It is the weight of water vapour per unit volume of air and is expressed in terms of grams per cubic metre.
What happens when humidity is high?,"When the humidity is high, there is a lot of water that can be used to make clouds. This results in rain or snow. The larger the amount of water, the more clouds we can have. "
What is precipitation?,"The process of continuous condensation in free air helps the condensed particles to grow in size. When the resistance of the air fails to hold them against the force of gravity, they fall onto the earth’s surface. So after the condensation of water vapour, the release of moisture is known as precipitation. This may take place in liquid or solid form. The precipitation in the form of water is called rainfall, when the temperature is lower than 0 degrees Celcius, precipitation takes place in the form of fine flakes of snow and is called snowfall."
What is the difference between rain and precipitation?,"Precipitation is any liquid or frozen water that forms in the atmosphere and falls back to the Earth. Precipitation forms in the clouds when water vapour condenses into bigger and bigger droplets of water. When the drops are heavy enough, they fall to the Earth. If a cloud is colder, like it would be at higher altitudes, the water droplets may freeze to form ice. These ice crystals then fall to the Earth as snow, hail, or rain, depending on the temperature within the cloud and at the Earth’s surface.The precipitation in the form of water is called rain. When the temperature is lower than 0 degrees Celsius (0°C), precipitation takes place in the form of fine flakes of snow and is called snowfall."
What causes rain?,"Evaporation:Water is absorbed from different water bodies, a large amount of which vaporizes and enters the atmospheric air. Water gets evaporated because of various other biological processes as well. Condensation:The hot air containing water molecules thus rises above the ground level expands and cools after reaching a suitable height. On cooling, water vapour turns into droplets of water, this process is called condensation. It is facilitated by substances such as dust and other particles suspended in the air which accelerates the process and forms the nucleus for these droplets.Precipitation:The cluster of such droplets clamps together to form huge water masses appearing to us like clouds. Once they grow big and heavy, they fall down to the ground as rain. When the temperature is lower than 0 degrees celsius, precipitation takes place in the form of fine flakes of snow and is called snowfall. "

What is the definition of evaporation?,"Evaporation is a process by which water is transformed from liquid to a gaseous state. Heat is the main cause of evaporation. The temperature at which the water starts evaporating is referred to as the latent heat of vapourisation.An increase in temperature increases the water absorption and retention capacity of the given parcel of air. Similarly, if the moisture content is low, the air has the potentiality of absorbing and retain moisture. The movement of air replaces the saturated layer with the unsaturated layer. Hence, the greater the movement of air, the greater is the evaporation."
What are the ocean deposits?,"Marine deposits are sediments that come from different sources by different means and it settle down in the ocean floor. Marine deposits are classified into many types based on sediments and location:Classification based on sediments:Pelagic- open sea, not close to the shore,Littoral- close to the shore,Hemipelagic- between littoral and pelagic,Eupelagic- uppermost part of the oceanic zone, lying above the mesopelagic zone, that receives enough sunlight to allow photosynthesis,Classification based on location:,Continental,Neritic- Shallow Sea,Pelagic- Deep Sea."
What is ocean salinity?,"All waters in nature, whether rainwater or ocean water, contain dissolved mineral salts. Salinity is the term used to define the total content of dissolved salts in seawater. It is calculated as the amount of salt (in gm) dissolved in 1,000 gm (1 kg) of seawater. It is usually expressed as parts per thousand (o/oo) or ppt. Salinity is an important property of seawater."
What causes ocean salinity?,"Salt in the ocean comes from two sources: runoff from the land and openings in the seafloor. Rocks on land are the major source of salts dissolved in seawater. Rainwater that falls on land is slightly acidic, so it erodes rocks. This releases ions that are carried away to streams and rivers that eventually feed into the ocean. Many of the dissolved ions are used by organisms in the ocean and are removed from the water. Others are not removed, so their concentrations increase over time.Other important sources of ocean salinity are:Hydrothermal fluids: Comes from vents in the seafloor.  The heated water is released through vents in the seafloor, carrying the metals with it. Some ocean salts come from underwater volcanic eruptions, which directly release minerals into the ocean.Salt domes: These domes, vast deposits of salt that form over geological timescales, are found underground and undersea around the world. "
Which ocean has salinity more than 37?,"Of the five ocean basins, the Atlantic Ocean is the saltiest. The surface waters of the North Atlantic have higher salinity than those of any other ocean, reaching values exceeding 37 parts per thousand in latitudes 20° to 30° N. "
What are the factors that affect the salinity of seawater?,"The salinity of water in the surface layer of oceans depend mainly on evaporation and precipitation.Surface salinity is greatly influenced in coastal regions by the freshwater flow from rivers, and in polar regions by the processes of freezing and thawing of ice.Wind also influences the salinity of an area by transferring water to other areas.The ocean currents contribute to the salinity variations. Salinity, temperature and density of water are interrelated. Hence, any change in the temperature or density influences the salinity of water in an area."
What are the sources of ocean deposits?,"Ocean deposits are the sediments that settle down on the ocean floor. They come from different sources and by different means. The following are the main sources of Ocean deposits:Terrestrial sediments,Volcanic sediments,Marine Organisms,Extraterrestrial(meteorites)"
Which type of ocean deposit is ooze?,Ooze is mud sediment on the bottom of an ocean or lakebed formed from the accumulation of skeletal and organic remains of microscopic organisms (phytoplankton and zooplankton). The oozes are subdivided first into Calcareous oozes-containing skeletons made of calcium carbonate.Siliceous oozes-containing skeletons made of silica.
How are marine deposits formed?,"Any deposit of insoluble material, primarily rock and soil particles, transported from land areas to the ocean by wind, ice, and rivers, as well as the remains of marine organisms, products of submarine volcanism, chemical precipitates from seawater, materials from outer space (meteorites) etc., accumulate on the seafloor and form marine deposits."
What is minor ocean relief?,"Mid-Oceanic Ridges: A mid-oceanic ridge is composed of two chains of mountains separated by a large depression. The mountain ranges can have peaks as high as 2,500 m and some even reach above the ocean’s surface.Seamount: It is a mountain with pointed summits, rising from the seafloor that does not reach the surface of the ocean. Seamounts are volcanic in origin. These can be 3,000-4,500 m tall. The Emperor seamount, an extension of the Hawaiian Islands in the Pacific Ocean, is a good example.Submarine Canyons: These are deep valleys, some comparable to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River. They are sometimes found cutting across the continental shelves and slopes, often extending from the mouths of large rivers. The Hudson Canyon is the best-known submarine canyon in the world.Guyots: It is a flat-topped seamount. They show evidence of gradual subsidence through stages to become flat topped submerged mountains. It is estimated that more than 10,000 seamounts and guyots exist in the Pacific Ocean alone.Atoll: These are low islands found in the tropical oceans consisting of coral reefs surrounding a central depression. It may be a part of the sea (lagoon), or sometimes form enclosing a body of fresh, brackish, or highly saline water."
What are oceans used for?,"Transportation:Around 80 per cent of global trade by volume and over 70 per cent of global trade by value are carried by sea and are handled by ports worldwide.,Recreation: From fishing to boating to kayaking and whale watching, the ocean provides us with many unique activities.,Economic benefits: The ocean is vital to the world’s economy, with more than 90% of trade using sea routes and as a source of jobs for millions of people.,Food:The ocean provides more than just seafood; ingredients from the sea are found in surprising foods such as peanut butter and soymilk.,Medicine:Many medicinal products come from the ocean, including ingredients that help fight cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer’s disease, and heart disease."
How many parts of ocean relief are there?,"The ocean floors can be divided into four major divisions:The Continental Shelf,The Continental Slope,The Deep Sea Plain,The Oceanic Deeps.Besides, these divisions there are also major and minor relief features in the ocean floors like ridges, hills, seamounts, guyots, trenches, canyons, etc."
What is the deepest part of the ocean floor?,"Oceanic Deeps or Trenches is the deepest part of the ocean. The trenches are relatively steep sided, narrow basins. They are some 3-5 km deeper than the surrounding ocean floor. They occur at the bases of continental slopes and along island arcs and are associated with active volcanoes and strong earthquakes. That is why they are very significant in the study of plate movements. As many as 57 deeps have been explored so far; of which 32 are in the Pacific Ocean; 19 in the Atlantic Ocean and 6 in the Indian Ocean."
Which ocean has the highest salinity?,"The Atlantic Ocean has the highest salinity of the five oceans. There is a distinct decrease of salinity near the equator and at both poles. Near the equator, the tropics receive the most rain on a consistent basis. As a result, the freshwater falling into the ocean helps decrease the salinity of the surface water in that region. At the poles, fresh water from melting ice decreases the surface salinity once again. "
What is ocean relief?,"The ocean water conceals a considerable variety of landscapes very similar to its counterpart on the continents. There are mountains, basins, plateaus, ridges, canyons and trenches beneath the ocean water too. These relief features found on the ocean floor are called ocean relief or submarine relief. . The Ocean basins are broadly divided into four major sub-divisions. They are:Continental shelf,Continental slope,Abyssal plains ,The ocean deeps."
What are the relief features of the oceans?,"The floors of the oceans are rugged with the world’s largest mountain ranges, deepest trenches and the largest plains. These features are formed, like those of the continents, by the factors of tectonic, volcanic and depositional processes. The ocean floors can be divided into four major divisions:Continental Shelf:The Continental shelf is the submerged portion of the continent that gradually slope seawards from the shoreline. A submarine canyon is a deep valley cut into a continental shelf and extends to a continental slope.Continental Slope :Continental slope is the steeply sloping part of the seafloor that marks the boundary between the seafloor and the continental shelf. The belt of sediments deposited along the base of the continental slope is called the continental rise.Abyssal Plain :Abyssal plains are extremely flat and featureless plains of the deep ocean floor. They cover a major portion of the ocean floor between the depth of 3000m to 6000m. These plains are covered with fine-grained sediments like clay and silt. The Ocean Deeps: The ocean deeps are the deepest part of the ocean. They are long, narrow, steep-sided and flat-floored depressions on the ocean floor. They are generally called submarine trenches. They are usually found adjacent to the areas of volcanic and earthquake activity. Great earthquakes and tsunamis are born in them. They occur in all the major oceans. The Pacific Ocean has the largest number of trenches. "
What is the example of an anticyclone?,"The wind circulation around a high is called anticyclonic circulation. Around a high, it is called anticyclonic circulation. An anticyclone is an area of high pressure where air moves apart and sinks. It typically indicates fair weather. Winds in an anticyclone blow clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.Siberian anticyclone is an example of a polar anticyclone, as is the high-pressure area that forms over Canada and Alaska during the winter."
What is an anticyclone?,"Anticyclone is a weather system with high barometric pressure at its centre, around which air slowly circulates in a clockwise direction in the northern hemisphere and anticlockwise direction in the southern hemisphere direction. Anticyclones are associated with calm, fine weather. "
What are glaciers made of?,"Glaciers are made of crystalline ice, snow, rock, sediment, and often liquid water that originates on land and moves downslope under the influence of its own weight and gravity. The movement of glaciers is slow, unlike water flow. The movement could be a few centimetres to a few metres a day or even less or more. "
What landforms are created by glacial erosion and deposition?,"Masses of ice moving as sheets over the land (continental glacier or piedmont glacier if a vast sheet of ice is spread over the plains at the foot of mountains) or as linear flows down the slopes of mountains in broad trough-like valleys (mountain and valley glaciers) are called glaciers. Glaciers form various glacial erosional and depositional forms like EROSIONAL LANDFORMS: Cirque, Horns and Serrated Ridges and Glacial Valleys/Troughs.,DEPOSITIONAL LANDFORMS: Moraines, Eskers, Outwash Plains and Drumlins."
What are deposition landforms of a glacier?,"DEPOSITIONAL LANDFORMS:Moraines: They are long ridges of deposits of glacial till. Terminal moraines are long ridges of debris deposited at the end (toe) of the glaciers. Lateral moraines form along the sides parallel to the glacial valleys. The lateral moraines may join a terminal moraine forming a horse-shoe shaped ridge.,Eskers: Very coarse materials like boulders and blocks along with some minor fractions of rock debris carried into this stream settle in the valley of ice beneath the glacier and after the ice melts can be found as a sinuous ridge called esker.,Outwash Plains: The plains at the foot of the glacial mountains or beyond the limits of continental ice sheets are covered with glacio-fluvial deposits in the form of broad flat alluvial fans which may join to form outwash plains of gravel, silt, sand and clay.,Drumlins: The drumlins form due to the dumping of rock debris beneath heavily loaded ice through fissures in the glacier. The stoss end gets blunted due to pushing by moving ice. Drumlins give an indication of the direction of glacier movement."
What causes glaciers to move?,"Glaciers move basically because of the force of gravity. Glaciers begin forming in places where more snow piles up each year than melts. Soon after falling, the snow begins to compress or become denser and tightly packed. It slowly changes from light, fluffy crystals to hard, round ice pellets. New snowfalls and buries this granular snow. The hard snow becomes even more compressed. It becomes dense, grainy ice called firn. The process of snow compacting into glacial firn is called firnification.As years go by, layers of firn build on top of each other. When the ice grows thick enough—about 50 meters (160 feet)—the firn grains fuse into a huge mass of solid ice. The glacier begins to move under its own weight. The glacier is so heavy and exerts so much pressure that the firn and snowmelt without any increase in temperature. The meltwater makes the bottom of the heavy glacier slicker and more able to spread across the landscape. The movement could be a few centimetres to a few metres a day or even less or more."
How does ice shape the land?,"A glacier is a huge mass of ice that moves slowly over land. Glaciers shape the land through processes of erosion, weathering, transportation and deposition, creating distinct landforms.Erosion: The two main types of erosion are abrasion and plucking.Abrasion: rocks that have been frozen into the base and sides of the glacier scrape the rock beneath. The rocks scrape the bedrock like sandpaper, leaving scratches called striations behind.Plucking – rocks become frozen into the bottom and sides of the glacier. As the glacier moves downhill it ‘plucks‘ the rocks frozen into the glacier from the ground.Weathering: During the day when temperatures are higher, the snow melts and water enters the cracks in the rock. When the temperature drops below 0°C the water in the crack freezes and expands by about 9 per cent. This makes the crack larger. As this process is repeated through continual thawing and freezing the crack gets larger over time. Eventually, pieces of rock break off."
What are pressure belts?,"A region on the earth that is dominated by either high pressure cells or low pressure cells is called a pressure belt. The horizontal distribution of air pressure across the latitudes is characterised by high or low-pressure belts. This is, however, a theoretical model because pressure belts are not always found as such on the earth. These pressure belts are: The Equatorial Low Pressure Belt,The Subtropic High Pressure Belts,The Sub-polar Low Pressure Betts,The Polar High Pressure Belts."
How are pressure belts caused?,"There is a pattern of alternate high and low-pressure belts over the earth. This is due to the spherical shape of the earth—different parts of the earth are heated unequally. The Equatorial region receives a great amount of heat throughout the year. Warm air being light, the air at the Equator rises, creating low pressure. At the poles the cold heavy air causes high pressure to be created/formed. It is also due to the rotation of the earth. In the Subpolar region around latitudes 60° to 65° North and South of the Equator, the rotation of the earth pushes up the bulk of the air towards the Equator, creating a low-pressure belt in this region."
What is pressure belt oscillation?,The pressure belts are not permanent in nature. They oscillate with the apparent movement of the sun. In the northern hemisphere in winter they move southwards and in the summer northwards. This phenomenon is known as pressure belt oscillation
What are the four pressure belts?,"The Equatorial Low-Pressure Belt,The Sub-tropical High-Pressure Belts,The Sub-polar low-Pressure Belts,The Polar High-Pressure Belts."
What are planetary winds?,Planetary or permanent winds blow from high-pressure belts to low-pressure belts in the same direction throughout the year. They blow over a vast area of continents and oceans. They are easterly and westerlies and polar easterlies.
How wind is created?,"Differences in atmospheric pressure generate winds. At the Equator, the sun warms the water and land more than it does the rest of the globe. Warm equatorial air rises higher into the atmosphere and migrates toward the poles. This is a low-pressure system. At the same time, cooler, denser air moves over Earth’s surface toward the Equator to replace the heated air. This is a high-pressure system. Winds generally blow from high-pressure areas to low-pressure areas."
What is an arid landform?,"Landforms are created in the arid region mostly by winds. Some landforms are also developed by water. Arid landforms are characterised by badlands, Mushroom rocks, dunes, yardang, etc. These features are typical in an arid region. There are three processes are involved by air for the creation of arid landform."
What is the source of wind?,"The wind is actually a form of solar energy. Winds are caused by the heating of the atmosphere by the sun, the rotation of the Earth, and the Earth’s surface irregularities. Therefore heating of the atmosphere by the sun is the main source of wind."
Is mushroom rock an Aeolian landform?,"Yes, mushroom rock is an Aeolian landform. In deserts, you can see rocks in the shape of a mushroom, commonly called mushroom rocks. Winds erode the lower section of the rock more than the upper part. Therefore, such rocks have a narrower base and wider top."
What happens in an anticyclone?,"The wind circulation around a high is called anticyclonic circulation. Around a high, it is called anticyclonic circulation. An anticyclone is an area of high pressure where air moves apart and sinks. It typically indicates fair weather. Winds in an anticyclone blow clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.Air at the centre of an anticyclone is forced away from its area of high pressure and replaced by a downward blast of air from higher altitudes. The air compresses and heats up as it moves downward, reducing its humidity and leading to fewer clouds within the anticyclone."
What landforms are created by glaciers?,"As glaciers continue to move, debris gets removed, divides get lowered and eventually the slope is reduced to such an extent that glaciers will stop moving leaving only a mass of low hills and vast outwash plains along with other depositional features. They form various glacial erosional and depositional forms like cirques, horns and serrated ridges, glacial valleys/troughs, moraines, eskers, outwash plains and drumlins."
How glacial landforms are formed?,"EROSIONAL LANDFORMS:Cirque:Cirques are bowl-shaped, amphitheatre like depressions that glaciers carve into mountains and valley sidewalls high elevations.Horns and Serrated Ridges: If three or more radiating glaciers cut headward until their cirques meet, high, sharp pointed and steep sided peaks called horns form. The divides between cirque side walls or head walls get narrow because of progressive erosion and turn into serrated or saw-toothed ridges sometimes referred to as arêtes with very sharp crest and a zig-zag outline,Glacial Valleys/Troughs: Glacial troughs, or glaciated valleys, are long, U-shaped valleys that were carved out by glaciers that have since receded or disappeared. Troughs tend to have flat valley floors and steep, straight sides.,DEPOSITIONAL LANDOFRMS:,Moraines: They are long ridges of deposits of glacial till. Terminal moraines are long ridges of debris deposited at the end (toe) of the glaciers. Lateral moraines form along the sides parallel to the glacial valleys. The lateral moraines may join a terminal moraine forming a horse-shoe shaped ridge.,Eskers: Very coarse materials like boulders and blocks along with some minor fractions of rock debris carried into this stream settle in the valley of ice beneath the glacier and after the ice melts can be found as a sinuous ridge called esker.,Outwash Plains: The plains at the foot of the glacial mountains or beyond the limits of continental ice sheets are covered with glacio-fluvial deposits in the form of broad flat alluvial fans which may join to form outwash plains of gravel, silt, sand and clay.,Drumlins: The drumlins form due to the dumping of rock debris beneath heavily loaded ice through fissures in the glacier. The stoss end gets blunted due to pushing by moving ice. Drumlins give an indication of the direction of glacier movement."
How are mountain glaciers are formed?,"These glaciers develop in high mountainous regions, often flowing out of icefields that span several peaks or even a mountain range. The largest mountain glaciers are found in Arctic Canada, Alaska, the Andes in South America, and the Himalayas in Asia."
What is faulting?,"Faulting happens when the Earth’s crust completely breaks and slides past each other. Rocks along a fault tend to move in opposite directions. As the overlying rock strata press them, the friction locks them together. Faulting results in the formation of block mountains and river valleys like the Narmada, Tapi."
What is the importance of folding and faulting?,"Faulting happens when the Earth’s crust completely breaks and slides past each other. Rocks along a fault tend to move in opposite directions. Folding leads to the development of fold mountains. For e.g., the Himalayas, the Alps, etc. Folding is a type of earth movement resulting from the horizontal compression of rock layers by internal forces of the earth along plate boundaries. Upfolds are termed as anticlines. The downfolds are termed synclines. Faulting results in the formation of block mountains like black forest mountains etc. and right valleys like the Narmada, Tapi, etc."
What is the difference between block mountains and fold mountains?,"Block mountains:Block Mountains are created when large areas are broken and displaced vertically. The uplifted blocks are termed as horsts and the lowered blocks are called graben. The Rhine valley and the Vosges mountain in Europe are examples of such mountain systems.Fold mountains:When two tectonic plates of the earth’s crust collide, they fold over each other and form mountains known as fold mountains. The Himalayan Mountains and the Alps are young fold mountains with rugged relief and high conical peaks. The Aravali range in India is one of the oldest fold mountain systems in the world. The range has considerably worn down due to the processes of erosion. The Appalachians in North America and the Ural mountains in Russia have rounded features and low elevation. They are very old fold mountains."
What is an example of a fluvial landform?,"Fluvial landforms are the landforms created by the movement and energy associated with rivers and streams. Examples of fluvial landforms are given below,Fluvial Erosional Landforms: Gorges, canyons waterfalls, rapids and river capture etc.,Fluvial Depositional Landforms: Floodplains, oxbow lakes, natural levees and Delta etc."
Is the Grand Canyon a fluvial landform?,"Yes, Grand Canyon is a fluvial landform. The Grand Canyon has been carved, over millions of years, as the Colorado River cuts through the Colorado Plateau. Fluvial landforms refer to landforms created by rivers and streams. It includes both erosional and depositional features created by these water bodies."
What are the types of fluvial landforms?,"There are two types of fluvial landforms. They are:Fluvial Erosional Landforms: Gorges, canyons waterfalls, rapids and river capture etc.Fluvial Depositional Landforms: Floodplains, oxbow lakes, natural levees and Delta etc."
What are the different types of fluvial processes?,"Fluvial landforms are the landforms created by the movement and energy associated with rivers and streams. There are two types of landforms created by the fluvial process. They are fluvial Erosional Landforms and fluvial Depositional Landforms. The fluvial processes may be divided into three different types. They are erosion, transportation and deposition."
What are the fluvial features of a river?,"Fluvial landforms refer to landforms created by rivers and streams. It includes both erosional and depositional features created by these water bodies. Gorges, canyons waterfalls, rapids, Floodplains, oxbow lakes, natural levees and Delta are some of the fluvial features of a river."
What are aeolian landforms?,"Aeolian landforms are formed by erosion, transportation, and deposition of sediment by the wind Aeolian processes create a number of distinct features, through both erosion and deposition of sediments. They are:Sand dunes,Loess Deposits,Ventifact,Yardangs,Deflation Hollow or Blowout,Desert Pavement"
What are the processes of aeolian erosion?,"Aeolian erosion develops through two principal processes. They are,Deflation: It is the process of removal of loosened material and its transport as fine grains in atmospheric suspension.Abrasion: It is the wearing away of relatively solid rock or indurated sediment."
What are Yardangs?,"A yardang is a fluted aerodynamic feature formed by eolian erosion. In arid regions, layers of hard and soft rocks are aligned vertically. As winds blow, the soft rocks get eroded, while the hard rock formations remain. Some of the abrasion undercuts parts of the rocks, and these formations are called yardangs."
Why is Earth's interior important?,"The configuration of the surface of the earth is largely a product of the processes operating in the interior of the earth. Exogenic as well as endogenic processes are constantly shaping the landscape. A proper understanding of the physiographic character of a region remains incomplete if the effects of endogenic processes are ignored. Human life is largely influenced by the physiography of the region. Therefore, it is necessary that one gets acquainted with the forces that influence landscape development. To understand why the earth shakes or how a tsunami wave is generated, it is necessary that we know certain details of the interior of the earth."
What is the difference between faulting and folding?,"Faulting:Faulting happens when the Earth’s crust completely breaks and slides past each other. Rocks along a fault tend to move in opposite directions. As the overlying rock strata press them, the friction locks them together.

How many major rivers flow from east to west in India?,"The two major west flowing rivers are Narmada and Tapi(or Tapti). Other important rivers that flow from west to east are Mahi, Sabarmati, Luni, Tawa and Sharavati."
Which is the longest west flowing river in India?,"Narmada is the longest west flowing river in India. It is the fifth largest river in the country and the largest one in Gujarat. It rises near the Amarkantak range of mountains in Madhya Pradesh and traverses Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat and meets the Gulf of Cambay. The total length of the river from source to sea is 1312 kilometres."
Why the west flowing rivers of peninsular India don’t form deltas?,"The slope of the Western Ghats is steep and that is the reason that these rivers have a rapid flow. They don’t have to travel much distance to drain into the sea. As a result, they don’t carry much sediments required to form deltas. At the same time, the Narmada and Tapti rivers flow in the rift valleys. So the eroded material carried by them gets deposited in the fractures of the fault zones."
Which rivers flow through the Eastern Ghats?,"East-flowing Indian rivers flow through the eastern ghats and merge into the Bay of Bengal. The rivers that flow through the Eastern Ghats are given below.Brahmani,Godavari,Kaveri,Krishna,Mahanadi,Subarnarekha,Tungabhadra"

It is one of the largest rivers of the world, has its origin in the Chemayungdung glacier of the Kailash range near the Mansarovar lake. The Brahmaputra receives numerous tributaries in its 750 km long journey through the Assam valley. Its major left bank tributaries are the Burhi Dihing and Dhansari (South) whereas the important right bank tributaries are the Subansiri, Kameng, Manas and Sankosh."
What are the Eastern Ghats?,"The Eastern Ghats stretch from the Mahanadi Valley to the Nilgiris in the south. The Eastern Ghats run from northern Odisha through Andhra Pradesh to Tamil Nadu in the south passing some parts of Karnataka.They are eroded and cut through by the four major rivers of peninsular India, known as the Godavari, Mahanadi, Krishna, and Kaveri.The Deccan Plateau lies to the west of the range, between the Eastern Ghats and the Western Ghats. The coastal plains, including the Coromandel Coast region, lie between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal.The Eastern Ghats are the source points for many small and medium rivers along the eastern coastal plains of South India.Mahendragiri (1,501 metres) is the highest peak in the Eastern Ghats. Shevroy Hills and the Javadi Hills are located to the southeast of the Eastern Ghats."
What is natural vegetation? Give examples.,"Natural vegetation refers to a plant community, which has grown naturally without human aid and has been left undisturbed by humans for a long time. This is termed as virgin vegetation. Thus, cultivated crops and fruits, orchards form part of vegetation but not natural vegetation. "
What are the types of natural vegetation?,"Natural vegetation refers to a plant community, which has grown naturally without human aid and has been left undisturbed by humans for a long time. This is termed as virgin vegetation. Thus, cultivated crops and fruits, orchards form part of vegetation but not natural vegetation. Vegetation regions can be divided into five major types:Forest,Grassland,Tundra,Desert,Ice sheet.The following major types of vegetation may be identified in our country. They are:Tropical Evergreen Forests ,Tropical Deciduous Forests ,Tropical Thorn Forests and Scrubs,Montane Forests ,Mangrove Forests."
Which type of vegetation is most spread in India?,"Tropical deciduous forests are the most widespread forests of India. They are also called the monsoon forests. They spread over regions that receive rainfall between 70-200 cm. On the basis of the availability of water, these forests are further divided into moist and dry deciduous."
What are the three layers of Earth?,"Earth’s interior is generally divided into three major layers: the crust, the mantle, and the core."
What is the inside of Earth made of?,The uppermost layer over the earth’s surface is called the crust. It is the thinnest of all the layers. It is about 35 km. on the continental masses and only 5 km. on the ocean floors. The main mineral constituents of the continental mass are silica and alumina. It is thus called sial (si-silica and al-alumina).The oceanic crust mainly consists of silica and magnesium. it is therefore called sima (si-silica and ma-magnesium). Just beneath the crust is the mantle which extends up to a depth of 2900 km. below the crust.The innermost layer is the core with a radius of about 3500 km. It is mainly made up of nickel and iron and is called nife (ni – nickel and fe – ferrous i.e. iron).
What is the end of a river called?,The end of a river is called the mouth of the river. It is the place where the river empties into another body of water such as a lake or ocean. All rivers have a starting point where the water begins its flow. This source is called a headwater.
Is Ganga a west flowing river?,"No, Ganga is not a west flowing river. It rises in the Gangotri glacier near Gaumukh (3,900 m) in the Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand. It flows eastwards and enters the plains at Haridwar. From here, it flows first to the south, then to the south-east and east before splitting into two distributaries, namely the Bhagirathi and the Padma. The river finally discharges itself into the Bay of Bengal near Sagar Island."
What is an example of a river basin?,"A river drainage basin is an area drained by a river and all of its tributaries.

What are the characteristics of a river basin?,"Characteristics of the river basin:Drainage basin – the area of land drained by a river.Catchment area – the area within the drainage basin.Watershed – the edge of highland surrounding a drainage basin that marks the boundary between two drainage basins.Source – the beginning or start of a river.Confluence – the point at which two rivers or streams join.Tributary – a stream or smaller river which joins a larger stream or river.Mouth – the point where the river comes to the end, usually when entering a sea."
Which is the largest river basin in the world?,"The Amazon Basin located in northern South America, is the largest river basin in the world. The Amazon River and all of its tributaries drain an area of more than 7 million square kilometres. "
How is a river basin formed?,"The main river along with all its tributaries that drain an area forms a river basin or the catchment area. A river basin is made up of many different watersheds. A watershed is a small version of a river basin. Every stream and tributary has its own watershed, which drains to a larger stream or wetland. These streams, ponds, wetlands, and lakes are part of a river basin. Every river is part of a network of watersheds that make up a river system’s entire drainage basin. All the water in the drainage basin flows downhill toward bigger rivers. "
Which river in India is called the Salt river?,"The River Luni is called the Salt River in India. It derived its name from the Sanskrit lavanavari (“salt river”) and is so called because of its excessive salinity. It is the only major river of the area, and it serves as an essential source of irrigation."
What is the difference between river and river basin?,"River:A river is a ribbon-like body of water that flows downhill from the force of gravity. A river can be wide and deep, or shallow enough for a person to wade across. A flowing body of water that is smaller than a river is called a stream, creek, or brook.River basin:A river drainage basin is an area drained by a river and all of its tributaries. A river basin is made up of many different watersheds. A watershed is a small version of a river basin. Every stream and tributary has its own watershed, which drains to a larger stream or wetland.

The Ghats covers six states of India(States of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra and Gujarat). These mountains cover an area of around 140,000 km² in a 1,600 km long stretch."
Is Sahyadri and the Western Ghats the same?,"Yes, Western Ghats is also called Sahyadri. The range is called Sahyadri in northern Maharashtra and Sahya Parvatam in Kerala. The Biligiri ranges southeast of Mysore in Karnataka, meet the Shevaroys (Servarayan range) and Tirumala range farther east, linking the Western Ghats to the Eastern Ghats. In the south, the range is known as the Nilagiri malai in Tamil Nadu."
What are the Western Ghats also called?,"The Western Ghats are also known as the Sahyadri Hills. The Western Ghats extend from the Satpura Range in the north, go south past Goa, through Karnataka and into Kerala and Tamil Nadu ending at Kanyakumari embracing the Indian ocean. "
Is Ooty in the Western Ghats?,"Yes, Ooty is in the Western Ghats. It is located at a height of 2240 m above sea level. Ooty is surrounded by hills on all sides.

Its major functions are:Collect rainfall water,Store water in various amounts and for different periods,Release water as runoff,Provide conditions and sites for various biochemical reactions to take place,Provide habitat for flora and fauna of various kinds."
What are the methods of watershed management?,"Watershed management basically refers to the efficient management and conservation of surface and groundwater resources. It involves the prevention of runoff and storage and recharge of groundwater through various methods like percolation tanks, recharge wells, etc. The methods of watershed management are:Contour bund,Bench terracing,Microcatchments for sloping lands,Check dam,Percolation pond,Stone Barriers"
What are the types of watershed?,"Watersheds are classified depending upon the size, drainage, shape and land use pattern.Macro watershed (> 50,000 Hect),Sub-watershed (10,000 to 50,000 Hect),Milli-watershed (1000 to10000 Hect),Micro watershed (100 to 1000 Hect),Mini watershed (1-100 Hect)."
What are the advantages of watershed management?,"Advantages:Reduces Pollution,It helps replenish the groundwater.,It is run and maintained by the locals. Therefore its benefits are distributed to the local people.,Mismanagement and over-exploitation of these natural resources are reduced because the locals are controlling them.,It helps to increase the production of crops.Disadvantages:Watershed building involves huge costs.,The area required for building a watershed should have adequate rainfall. So the areas where a watershed can be built are very few.Watersheds require regular maintenance."
When was Indian National Water Policy started?,The first National Water Policy was adopted in September 1987. It was reviewed and updated in 2002 and later in 2012. It was formulated to govern the planning and development of water resources and their optimum utilisation.
What is a watershed? Give example.,"A watershed is an area of land that drains or “sheds” water into a specific waterbody. Everybody of water has a watershed. Watersheds drain rainfall and snowmelt into streams and rivers. These smaller bodies of water flow into larger ones, including lakes, bays, and oceans. Gravity helps to guide the path that water takes across the landscape.Example: The Mississippi and Missouri Rivers are the two longest rivers in North America, and together form the backbone of the much larger Mississippi watershed that supplies fresh water to a huge portion of the continental United States."
What is Jal Shakti Abhiyan India?,"Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) is a time-bound, mission-mode water conservation campaign.

Alappuzha has always enjoyed an important place in the maritime history of Kerala. It is famous for its boat races, backwater holidays, beaches, canals, backwaters lagoons, marine products and coir industry."
Can lagoon be called lake?,"No, Lagoons are different from lakes. Lagoons are calm and shallow water bodies surrounded by barriers. They are formed when a shallow water body is separated from a large water body by a small landmass, resulting in the formation of a relief feature that resembles a partially enclosed lake. Lakes refer to an area that is filled with water in a localized basin and typically surrounded by land. They are found mainly inland, and they do not form part of the oceans, distinguishing them from lagoons."
Are lagoons calm?,"Yes, Lagoons are calm and shallow water bodies surrounded by barriers. They are protected from a larger body of water (usually the ocean) by sandbars, barrier islands, or coral reefs. Lagoons are often called estuaries, sounds, bays, or even lakes. They are formed when a shallow water body is separated from a large water body by a small landmass, resulting in the formation of a relief feature that resembles a partially enclosed lake."

What is an example of common property resources?,"Community forests, pasture lands, village water bodies and other public spaces where a group larger than a household or family unit exercises rights of use and carries the responsibility of management are examples of common property resources. CPRs can be defined as a community’s natural resource, where every member has the right of access and usage with specified obligations, without anybody having property rights over them."
What is a common property resource?,"CPRs can be defined as a community’s natural resource, where every member has the right of access and usage with specified obligations, without anybody having property rights over them. CPRs provide fodder for the livestock and fuel for the households along with other minor forest products like fruits, nuts, fibre, medicinal plants, etc. In rural areas, such land is of particular relevance for the livelihood of the landless and marginal farmers and other weaker sections since many of them depend on income from their livestock due to the fact that they have limited access to land. CPRs also are important for women as most of the fodder and fuel collection is done by them in rural areas."
Why common property resource is important?,"Common property resource is important because it provides fodder for the livestock and fuel for the households along with other minor forest products like fruits, nuts, fibre, medicinal plants, etc. In rural areas, such land is of particular relevance for the livelihood of the landless and marginal farmers and other weaker sections since many of them depend on income from their livestock due to the fact that they have limited access to land. CPRs also are important for women as most of the fodder and fuel collection is done by them in rural areas. "
What are the types of urban settlements?,"Town: The concept of ‘town’ can best be understood with reference to ‘village’. Population size is not the only criterion. Functional contrasts between towns and villages may not always be clear-cut, but specific functions such as manufacturing, retail and wholesale trade, and professional services exist in towns.City: A city may be regarded as a leading town, which has outstripped its local or regional rivals. In the words of Lewis Mumford, “ the city is in fact the physical form of the highest and most complex type of associative life”. Cities are much larger than towns and have a greater number of economic functions. They tend to have transport terminals, major financial institutions and regional administrative offices. When the population crosses the one million mark it is designated as a million city.Conurbation: The term conurbation was coined by Patrick Geddes in 1915 and applied to a large area of urban development that resulted from the merging of originally separate towns or cities. Greater London, Manchester, Chicago and Tokyo are examples.Megalopolis: This Greek word meaning “great city”, was popularised by Jean Gottman (1957) and signifies a ‘super- metropolitan’ region extending, as union of conurbations. The urban landscape stretching from Boston in the north to south of Washington in the U.S.A. is the best-known example of a megalopolis.Million City: When the population crosses the one million mark it is designated as a million city. The number of million cities in the world has been increasing as never before. London reached the million mark in 1800, followed by Paris in 1850, New York in 1860, and by 1950 there were around 80 such cities. "
Which land comes under common property resources?,"Common property resources include all such resources that are meant for the common use of the villagers. CPRs include all resources like village pastures and grazing grounds, village forests and woodlots, protected and unclassed government forests, waste land, common threshing grounds, watershed drainage, ponds and tanks, rivers, rivulets, water reservoirs, canals and irrigation channels. These resources were largely under the control of local communities."
What are the problems of urbanization?,"Shortage of housing, vertical expansion and growth of slums are characteristic features of modern cities of developing countries.The decreasing employment opportunities in the rural, as well as smaller urban areas of the developing countries, consistently push the population to the urban areas. The enormous migrant population generates a pool of unskilled and semi-skilled labour force, which is already saturated in urban areas.Insufficient financial resources fail to create adequate social infrastructure catering to the basic needs of the huge population.The large urban population in developing countries not only uses but also disposes off a huge quantity of water and all types of waste materials. Many cities of the developing countries even find it extremely difficult to provide the minimum required quantity of potable water and water for domestic and industrial uses."
What are the common property resources of rural areas?,"The CPRs have traditionally been a source of economic sustenance of the rural poor and have played an important resource-supplementing role in the private-property based farming system. They are also the main source of biomass fuel for the rural population. In India, CPRs include village pastures and grazing grounds, village forests and woodlots, protected and unclassed government forests, wastelands, common threshing grounds, watershed drainage, ponds and tanks, rivers, rivulets, water reservoirs, canals and irrigation channels. "
What are the main characteristics of urban settlements?,"The main characteristics of urban settlements are:The main occupation of the people is related to secondary and tertiary sectors.There is a density of human structures such as houses, commercial buildings, roads, bridges, and railways.Urban settlements are large in size with a high density of population."
What are the major water resources?,"Major water resources in India are surface water resources like rivers, lakes, ponds and tanks, and groundwater. The mean annual flow in all the river basins in India is estimated to be 1,869 cubic km. The total replenishable groundwater resources in the country are about 432 cubic km. The level of groundwater utilisation is relatively high in the river basins lying in the north-western region and parts of south India."
What are the main causes of Urbanisation?,"Industrialization: More people have been attracted to move from rural to urban areas on account of improved employment opportunities.Commercialization:Better commercial opportunities and returns compared to rural areas.Social Benefits and Services: Urban areas provide better educational facilities, better living standards, better sanitation and housing, better health care, better recreation facilities, and better social life in general.Employment Opportunities: Services and industries in urban areas generate and increase higher value-added jobs, and this leads to more employment opportunities.Modernization and Changes in the Mode of Living: Availability of highly sophisticated communication, infrastructure, medical facilities, dressing code, enlightenment, liberalization, and other social amenities in urban areas make people believe that they can lead a happy life in cities.Rural-urban Transformation: Rural communities start to adopt the urban culture and ultimately become urban centres that continue to grow as more people move to such locations in search of a better life."
What are the sources of water pollution?,"Sewage (Waste Water):The sewage water carries pathogens, a typical water pollutant, other harmful bacterias, and chemicals that can cause serious health problems and thereby diseases.Agricultural Pollution: Chemical fertilizers and pesticides are used by farmers to protect crops from insects and bacterias. However, when these chemicals are mixed up with water, they produce harmful pollutants for plants and animals.Oil Pollution: Oil spill poses a huge threat to marine life when a large amount of oil spills into the sea and does not dissolve in water. It causes problems for local marine wildlife, including fish, birds, and sea otters.Industrial Waste: Industries produce a tremendous amount of waste, which contains toxic chemicals and pollutants, causing air pollution and damage to our environment and us.The burning of fossil fuels: Fossil fuels like coal and oil, when burnt, produce a substantial amount of ash in the atmosphere. The particles which contain toxic chemicals when mixed with water vapour result in acid rain.River dumping and Marine Dumping: The garbage produced by households in the form of paper, plastic, food, aluminium, rubber, glass, is collected and dumped into the rivers and seas., they not only cause water pollution but also harm aquatic animals."
Which state has the highest urbanization in India?,"Goa is now the most urbanised State with 62.2% urban population among states. Among all the States and Union territories, the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the Union territory of Chandigarh are most urbanized with 97.5% and 97.25% urban population respectively, followed by Daman and Diu (75.2%) and Puducherry (68.3%). Among major states, Tamil Nadu continues to be the most urbanized state with 48.4% of the population living in urban areas followed now by Kerala (47.7%) upstaging Maharashtra (45.2%).,Positive Effects of Urbanization:Creation of employment opportunities,Technological and infrastructural advancements,Improved transportation and communication,Quality educational and medical facilities,Improved standards of living.Negative effects of urbanisation:Population increase causes housing problems.,Overcrowding,Unemployment,Development of Slums,Water and Sanitation Problems,Poor Health and Spread of Diseases,Traffic Congestion,Urban Crime."

What are the different land use categories?,"The land-use categories as maintained in the Land Revenue Records are:Forests,Land put to Non-agricultural Uses,Barren and Wastelands,Area under Permanent Pastures and Grazing Lands,Area under Miscellaneous Tree Crops and Groves(Not included is Net sown Area) ,Culturable Waste-Land,Current Fallow,Fallow other than Current Fallow,Net Area Sown."
What is land use? Give examples.,"Land is used for different purposes such as agriculture, forestry, mining, building houses, roads and setting up of industries. This is commonly termed as Land use.Examples:Forests,Land put to Non-agricultural Uses,Barren and Wastelands,The area under Permanent Pastures and Grazing Lands,The area under Miscellaneous Tree Crops and Groves(Not included is Net sown Area) ,Culturable Waste-Land,Current Fallow,Fallow other than Current Fallow,Net Area Sown "
Which type of land use is maximum?,Net Area Sown category of land use is maximum in India. The physical extent of land on which crops are sown and harvested is known as net sown area. 
What is land use classification?,"Land use classification is the systematic arrangement of various classes of land on the basis of certain similar characteristics, mainly to identify and understand their fundamental utilities, intelligently and effectively in satisfying the needs of human society. It provides information on land cover and the types of human activity involved in land use. It may also facilitate the assessment of environmental impacts on, and potential or alternative uses of, land. Land use classification is of great significance in land use and land cover as it is the most fundamental step of land use analysis. "
What are the uses of land?,"Land is used for different purposes such as agriculture, forestry, mining, building houses, roads and setting up of industries. This is commonly termed Land use. The use of land is determined by physical factors such as topography, soil, climate, minerals and availability of water. Human factors such as population and technology are also important determinants of land use patterns."
Why is the land use pattern changing in India?,"Land use in a region, to a large extent, is influenced by the nature of economic activities carried out in that region. The types of changes that an economy undergoes, which affect land use are:The size of the economy (measured in terms of value for all the goods and services produced in the economy) grows over time as a result of increasing population, change in income levels, available technology and associated factors. As a result, the pressure on land will increase with time and marginal lands would come underuse.The composition of the economy would undergo a change over time. In other words, the secondary and the tertiary sectors usually grow much faster than the primary sector, specifically the agricultural sector. This type of change is common in developing countries like India. This process would result in a gradual shift of land from agricultural uses to non-agricultural uses.In developing countries like India, the share of the population dependent on agriculture usually declines much more slowly compared to the decline in the sector’s share in GDP."
What are the changes in land use patterns?,"India has undergone major changes within the economy over the past four or five decades, and this has influenced the land-use changes in the country. Four categories have undergone increases, while four have registered declines. Share of area under forest, the area under non-agricultural uses, current fallow lands and net area sown have shown an increase. The four categories that have registered a decline are barren and wasteland, culturable wasteland, area under pastures and tree crops and fallow lands."
What is migration and what are its causes?,"Migration is defined as movement from one country, place or locality to another in search of better opportunities to settle.When people move from one place to another, the place they move from is called the Place of Origin and the place they move to is called the Place of Destination. People migrate for a better economic and social life. There are two sets of causes or factors that influence migration.Push factors make the place of origin seem less attractive for reasons like unemployment, poor living conditions, political turmoil, unpleasant climate, natural disasters, epidemics and socio-economic backwardness.Pull factors make the place of destination seem more attractive than the place of origin for reasons like better job opportunities and living conditions, peace and stability, security of life and property and pleasant climate."
What are the types of human settlements?,"Human settlements can broadly be divided into two types – rural and urban.Rural settlements: Rural settlements are most closely and directly related to land. They are dominated by primary activities such as agriculture, animal husbandry, fishing etc. The settlements size is relatively small.Urban Settlements: Rapid urban growth is a recent phenomenon. Until recent times, few settlements reached the population size of more than a few thousand inhabitants."
Who are migrants?,"A person who moves from one place to another in order to find work or better living conditions is called a migrant. Migrants are of three types.Emigrant: a person who is leaving one country to live in another.,Immigrant: a person who is entering a country from another to make a new home.,Refugee: a person who has moved to a new country because of a problem in their former home."
What factors influence rural settlements?,"Water Supply: Usually rural settlements are located near water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and springs where water can be easily obtained.Land: People choose to settle near fertile lands suitable for agriculture.Upland: Upland which is not prone to flooding was chosen to prevent damage to houses and loss of life.Building Material: The availability of building materials- wood, stone near settlements is another advantage. Early villages were built in forest clearings where wood was plentiful.Defence: During times of political instability, war, the hostility of neighbouring groups villages were built on defensive hills and islands.Planned Settlements: Sites that are not spontaneously chosen by villagers themselves, planned settlements are constructed by governments by providing shelter, water and other infrastructures on acquired lands."
What causes migration?,"Causes of Migration:People migrate for a better economic and social life. There are two sets of factors that influence migration. Push factors: the place of origin seem less attractive for reasons like unemployment, poor living conditions, political turmoil, unpleasant climate, natural disasters, epidemics and socio-economic backwardness.Pull factors: the place of destination seems more attractive than the place of origin for reasons like better job opportunities and living conditions, peace and stability, security of life and property and pleasant climate."
What is urban settlement?,"The definition of urban areas varies from one country to another. Some of the common bases of classification are the size of the population, occupational structure and administrative setup.Population Size: The lower limit of the population size for a settlement to be designated as urban is 1,500 in Colombia, 2,000 in Argentina and Portugal, 2,500 in U.S.A. and Thailand, 5,000 in India and 30,000 in Japan. Besides the size of the population, the density of 400 persons per sq km and the share of non-agricultural workers are taken into consideration in India.Occupational Structure: In some countries, such as India, the major economic activities in addition to the size of the population in designating a settlement as urban are also taken as a criterionAdministration: The administrative setup is a criterion for classifying a settlement as urban in some countries. For example, in India, a settlement of any size is classified as urban, if it has a municipality, Cantonment Board or Notified Area Council."
What are the advantages and disadvantages of migration?,"Advantages of migration:Remittances from international migrants are one of the major sources of foreign exchange.Migration from rural areas of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha to the rural areas of Punjab, Haryana, Western Uttar Pradesh accounted for the success of their green revolution strategy for agricultural development.Migrants act as agents of social change. The new ideas related to new technologies, family planning, girls’ education, etc. get diffused from urban to rural areas through them.Migration leads to intermixing of people from diverse cultures. It has positive contribution such as the evolution of composite cultureDisadvantages of migration:Unregulated migration to the metropolitan cities of India has caused overcrowding. The development of slums in industrially developed states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Delhi is a negative consequence of unregulated migration within the country.Rural-urban migration is one of the important factors contributing to the population growth of cities. Age and skill selective out-migration from the rural area have an adverse effect on the rural demographic structure.High out-migration from Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Eastern Maharashtra have brought serious imbalances in age and sex composition in these states."
Who are called immigrants?,"Migrants who move into a new place are called Immigrants. Historically, the process of immigration has been of great social, economic, and cultural benefit to states. The immigration experience is long and varied and resulted in the development of multicultural societies; many modern states are characterized by a wide variety of cultures and ethnicities that have derived from previous periods of immigration."
What is the difference between emigrant and immigrant?,A person who moves from one place to another in order to find work or better living conditions is called a migrant. Migrants are mainly of two types.Immigrants: Migrants who move into a new place are called Immigrants.Emigrants: Migrants who move out of a place are called Emigrants.
What is human development?,"“Human development is a process of enlarging the range of people’s choices, increasing their opportunities for education, health care, income and empowerment and covering the full range of human choices from a sound physical environment to economic, social and political freedom.”Thus, enlarging the range of people’s choices is the most significant aspect of human development. People’s choices may involve a host of other issues, but, living a long and healthy life, being educated and have access to resources needed for a decent standard of living including political freedom, guaranteed human rights and personal self-respect, etc. are considered some of the non-negotiable aspects of the human development.

"
What is meant by human settlement?,"Human Settlement means a cluster of dwellings of any type or size where human beings live. For this purpose, people may erect houses and other structures and command some area or territory as their economic support base. Thus, the process of settlement inherently involves the grouping of people and apportioning of territory as their resource base."
What are the types of rural settlements?,"Clustered, agglomerated or nucleated: The clustered rural settlement is a compact or closely built-up area of houses. In this type of village, the general living area is distinct and separated from the surrounding farms, barns and pastures. The closely built-up area and its intervening streets present some recognisable pattern or geometric shape, such as rectangular, radial, linear, etc. Such settlements are generally found in fertile alluvial plains and in the northeastern states.Semi-clustered or fragmented: Semi-clustered or fragmented settlements may result from a tendency of clustering in a restricted area of dispersed settlement. More often such a pattern may also result from segregation or fragmentation of a large compact village.Hamleted: Sometimes settlement is fragmented into several units physically separated from each other bearing a common name. These units are locally called panna, para, palli, nagla, dhani, etc. in various parts of the country. This segmentation of a large village is often motivated by social and ethnic factors. Such villages are more frequently found in the middle and lower Ganga plain, Chhattisgarh and lower valleys of the Himalayas.Dispersed or isolated: Dispersed or isolated settlement pattern in India appears in the form of isolated huts or hamlets of few huts in remote jungles, or on small hills with farms or pasture on the slopes. Extreme dispersion of settlement is often caused by the extremely fragmented nature of the terrain and land resource base of habitable areas."
What is migration?,"Migration is defined as movement from one country, place or locality to another in search of better opportunities to settle.When people move from one place to another, the place they move from is called the Place of Origin and the place they move to is called the Place of Destination. Migration may be permanent, temporary or seasonal. It may take place from rural to rural areas, rural to urban areas, urban to urban areas and urban to rural areas"
What are the features of rural settlement?,"Features of rural settlement:Settlements are small and sparsely spaced.Derive their life support or basic economic needs from land-based primary economic activities.Rural people are less mobile and therefore, social relations among them are intimate."
What are the types of migration?,"Internal migration: moving within a state, country, or continent,External migration: moving to a different state, country, or continent,Emigration: leaving one place to move to another,Immigration: moving into a new place ,Return migration: moving back to where you came from,Seasonal migration: moving with each season or in response to labour or climate conditions."
What is the main occupation of the rural settlement?,The rural settlements derive their life support or basic economic needs from land-based primary economic activities. The main occupation of the rural settlements is agriculture and other primary activities.
Is temperate a climate?,"Yes, temperate is a climate. The temperate climates of Earth occur in the middle latitudes (40° to 60° N/S of Equator), which span between the tropics and the polar regions of Earth. The Köppen climate classification defines a climate as “temperate” when the mean temperature is above −3 °C but below 18 °C in the coldest month."
Which climate zone is the hottest?,"The tropical zone is the hottest climatic zone. According to Koeppen’s classification, tropical regions come under the A-group where the average temperature of the coldest month is 18° C or higher."
What is the example of climate?,"Climate is the long-term pattern of weather in an area, typically averaged over a period of 30 years. For example, the South-West monsoons blow from June to September every year in India."
What are the main causes of climate change?,"Increased use of fossil fuels: World’s energy needs are met by coal, oil and gas to generate electricity, run cars and other forms of transport, and power manufacturing and industry.Deforestation: Living trees absorb and store carbon dioxide. Cutting trees increases the CO2% in the atmosphere which is a greenhouse gas.Intensive agriculture: It emits greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide."
What are the three types of ocean movements?,"Waves: Waves are actually the energy, not the water as such, which moves across the ocean surface. Water particles only travel in a small circle as a wave passes. Wind provides energy to the waves. Wind causes waves to travel in the ocean and the energy is released on shorelines.Tides: The periodical rise and fall of the sea level, once or twice a day, mainly due to the attraction of the sun and the moon, is called a tide.Currents: Ocean currents are like river flow in oceans. They represent a regular volume of water in a definite path and direction."
What drives the vertical movement of ocean water?,"The vertical motion of ocean water refers to tides. It is the rise and fall of water in the oceans and seas. Due to the attraction of the sun and the moon, the ocean water is raised up and falls down twice a day. The moon’s gravitational pull to a great extent and to a lesser extent the sun’s gravitational pull, are the major causes for the occurrence of tides. Another factor is centrifugal force, which is the force that acts to counterbalance gravity. Together, the gravitational pull and the centrifugal force are responsible for creating the two major tidal bulges on the earth."
What are the 5 major ocean gyres?,"Ocean gyres are large systems of circular ocean currents formed by global wind patterns and forces created by Earth’s rotation. The five major circulation patterns formed by the currents on this map are the world’s five major ocean gyres. They areNorth Atlantic,South Atlantic,Indian,North Pacific,South Pacific."
How old is the earth?,"The earth was formed sometime about 4.6 billion years ago. The earth was mostly in a volatile state during its primordial stage. Due to a gradual increase in density the temperature inside has increased. As a result, the material inside started getting separated depending on their densities. This allowed heavier materials (like iron) to sink towards the centre of the earth and the lighter ones to move towards the surface. Starting from the surface to the central parts, we have layers like the crust, mantle, outer core and inner core. From the crust to the core, the density of the material increases."
How is density of population measured?,"The density of population is the ratio between the numbers of people to the size of land. It is usually measured in persons per sq.km. For example, the area of Region X is 100 sq km and the population is 1,50,000 persons. The density of population is calculated by dividing 1,50,000 by 100. The density of population is equal to 1,500 person/sq km."
What country has the highest population density?,"According to world bank data, Macao SAR, China has the highest population density in the world. It has a population density of 19,737 persons per sq.km. It is followed by Monaco, Singapore and Bahrain."
How much percent of water vapour is in the atmosphere?,"Water vapour varies from zero to four per cent by volume of the atmosphere. Water is present in the atmosphere in three forms namely – gaseous, liquid and solid. The moisture in the atmosphere is derived from water bodies through evaporation and from plants through transpiration. Thus, there is a continuous exchange of water between the atmosphere, the oceans and the continents through the processes of evaporation, transpiration, condensation and precipitation. "
Which country has the lowest average population density?,"According to world bank data, Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world. It has a population density of 2 persons per sq.km. "
What is the atmosphere made of?,"The atmosphere is composed of gases, water vapour and dust particles. It consists of about 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, 0.9 percent argon, and 0.1 percent other gases."
What is the density of population of India?,"According to world bank data 2020, the density of the population of India is 464 sq.km. As per the provisional population totals of the census 2011, the population density of India has gone up to 382 persons per square kilometres from 325 persons per sq.km in 2001."
What is the importance of water vapour in the atmosphere?,Importance of water vapour in the atmosphere:It bsorbs parts of the insolation from the sun and preserves the earth’s radiated heat.It acts like a blanket allowing the earth neither to become too cold nor too hot.Water vapour also contributes to the stability and instability in the air.
Why is India so densely populated?,"Availability of water: People prefer to live in areas where freshwater is easily available. India has numerous river systems like the Ganga, Godavari, Krishna and Kauvery that support the growth of population.Landforms: The great plains of North India and the coastal plains favour the production of crops and to build roads and industries.Climate: Most parts of India has moderate climatic conditions. The southwest monsoons bring rains that favour moderate climate, crop cultivation and economic growth.Soils: Fertile soils of Northern plains and the coastal plains are important for the development of agricultural and allied activities."
What is the most abundant gas in Earth's atmosphere?,Nitrogen is the most abundant gas in Earth’s atmosphere. It constitutes around 78.08 Percentage by Volume in the atmosphere.
What is the least populated country in the world?,Vatican city is the least populated country in the world with a population of just over 800 persons. Vatican City is the world’s smallest fully independent nation-state.
What are the types of climate?,"Koeppen recognised five major climatic groups, four of which are based on temperature and one on precipitation. They are  A (Tropical), B ( Dry Climates ), C (Warm Temperate), D (Cold Snow Forest Climates), and E ( Cold Climates). "
What is the coldest climate zone?,"Koeppen recognised five major climatic groups. They are A (Tropical), B ( Dry Climates ), C (Warm Temperate), D (Cold Snow Forest Climates), and E ( Cold Climates). D-group and E-group are the cold climate zones. The average temperature of the coldest month is minus 3° C or below for D-group and the average temperature for all months is below 10° C for E-group."
What is the process of atmospheric circulation?,"Air expands when heated and gets compressed when cooled. This results in variations in the atmospheric pressure. The result is that it causes the movement of air from high pressure to low pressure, setting the air in motion. Generally, over low pressure area the air will converge and rise. Over high pressure area the air will subside from above and diverge at the surface. Apart from convergence, some eddies, convection currents, orographic uplift and uplift along fronts cause the rising of air, which is essential for the formation of clouds and precipitation."
What is an example of atmospheric circulation?,El Nino and La Nina are examples of atmospheric circulation. El Niño is a climate pattern that describes the unusual warming of surface waters in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean.La Nina is caused by a build-up of cooler-than-normal waters in the eastern tropical Pacific. 
What are the 3 types of atmospheric circulation cells?,"The 3 types of atmospheric circulation cells are the Hadley cell, the Ferrel cell, and the polar cell:Hadley cell: Occurs between the Equator and the Tropics,Ferrel cell: Occurs between 30 degrees N and S to 60 degrees N and S.polar cell: Occurs between 60 and 70 degrees north and south, to the poles."
What are the main causes of atmospheric circulation?,Differential heating of the atmosphere causes air to rise at some locations and sink at some locations.Earth’s rotation on its axis. Unequal distribution of land and water masses on the planet.
What are the factors affecting atmospheric circulation?,"The major factors affecting global atmospheric circulation are:Uneven heating of earth’s surface,Seasonal changes in temperature and precipitation ,Rotating of earth on its axis,Properties of air and water ,Variation in the amount of solar energy striking the earth."
What is water in the atmosphere called?,"Water is present in the atmosphere in three forms namely – gaseous, liquid and solid. Water present in gaseous form is called Water vapour. It varies from zero to four per cent by volume of the atmosphere and plays an important role in the weather phenomena."
Which country ranks first in Human Development Index?,"According to Human Development Report 2020, Norway ranks first in Human Development Index with HDI value of 0.957. It is followed by Ireland, Switzerland and Hongkong. India’s position is 131 with HDI value of 0.645. "
What does solar radiation do to humans?,"Sunlight, an essential prerequisite for life. But it can be dangerous to human health. Excessive exposure to the sun might cause risks of various skin cancers, cataracts and other eye diseases, as well as accelerated skin ageing. It may also adversely affect people’s ability to resist infectious diseases and compromise the effectiveness of vaccination programmes."
What is a solar cycle?,"Every 11 years or so, the Sun’s magnetic field completely flips. This means that the Sun’s north and south poles switch places. Then it takes about another 11 years for the Sun’s north and south poles to flip back again. The solar cycle is the cycle that the Sun’s magnetic field goes through approximately every 11 years. The solar cycle affects activity on the surface of the Sun, such as sunspots which are caused by the Sun’s magnetic fields."
How much solar radiation reaches the earth?,"According to measurements made by the most recent NASA satellite missions, at Earth’s average distance from the Sun (about 150 million kilometres), the average intensity of solar energy reaching the top of the atmosphere directly facing the Sun is about 1,360 watts per square meter."
What are the negative effects of solar energy?,"Excessive UV exposure results in a number of chronic skin changes. These include various skin cancers of which melanoma is the most life-threatening.UV exposure of the eye depends on many factors: ground reflection, the degree of brightness in the sky leading to activation of the squint reflex, the amount of atmospheric reflection, and the use of eyewear.A number of studies indicate that UV exposures at environmental levels suppress immune responses in both rodents and humans.Excessive infrared radiation can result in heat strokes and other similar reactions particularly in elderly, infirm or very young individuals."
Which theory tries to explain the distribution of oceans and continents?,"The continental drift theory tries to explain the distribution of oceans and continents. This theory was put forth by German scientist Alfred Wegener. In 1912. According to this theory, all the continents formed a single continental mass and mega ocean surrounded the same. The supercontinent was named PANGAEA, which meant all earth. The mega-ocean was called PANTHALASSA, meaning all water. He argued that, around 200 million years ago, the supercontinent, Pangaea, began to split. Pangaea first broke into two large continental masses as Laurasia and Gondwanaland forming the northern and southern components respectively. Subsequently, Laurasia and Gondwanaland continued to break into various smaller continents that exist today."
Which sea separates Africa from Asia?,"Red sea separates the continent of Asia and Africa. The Isthmus of Suez in eastern Egypt connects the continents of Africa and Asia and separates the Mediterranean sea and the Red Sea. It is one of the main routes used for the transportation of oil and is also useful in carrying trade from surrounding countries like Europe, Saudi Arabia, and various other eastern countries."
What is Convectional current theory?,"Convectional Current Theory was given by Arthur Holmes in the 1930s. It discussed the possibility of convection currents operating in the mantle portion These currents are generated due to radioactive elements causing thermal differences in the mantle portion. Holmes argued that there exists a system of such currents in the entire mantle portion. This was an attempt to provide an explanation to the issue of force, on the basis of which contemporary scientists discarded the continental drift theory."
How did Earths oceans form?,"Continuous volcanic eruptions contributed water vapour and gases to the atmosphere. As the earth cooled, the water vapour released started getting condensed. The carbon dioxide in the atmosphere got dissolved in rainwater and the temperature further decreased causing more condensation and more rains. The rainwater falling onto the surface got collected in the depressions to give rise to oceans. The earth’s oceans were formed within 500 million years from the formation of the earth. This tells us that the oceans are as old as 4,000 million years. Sometime around 3,800 million years ago, life began to evolve. "
Which is called mega ocean?,"The mega-ocean was called PANTHALASSA, meaning all water. According to Wegener, all the continents formed a single continental mass and mega ocean surrounded the same. The supercontinent was named PANGAEA, which meant all earth. He argued that, around 200 million years ago, the supercontinent, Pangaea, began to split. Pangaea first broke into two large continental masses as Laurasia and Gondwanaland forming the northern and southern components respectively. Subsequently, Laurasia and Gondwanaland continued to break into various smaller continents that exist today. "
What type of radiation is solar?,"Solar radiation is a general term for the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the sun. Solar radiation can be captured and turned into useful forms of energy, such as heat and electricity, using a variety of technologies."
What causes solar radiation?,"Solar radiation is caused by nuclear fusion that takes place in the sun.Fusion occurs when protons of hydrogen atoms violently collide in the sun’s core and fuse to create a helium atom. This process, known as a PP (proton-proton) chain reaction, emits an enormous amount of energy. At its core, the Sun fuses about 620 million metric tons of hydrogen every second. Solar energy is constantly flowing away from the sun and throughout the solar system."
What is solar radiation and why is it important?,"Solar radiation is radiant (electromagnetic) energy from the sun. It is important because it provides light and heat for the Earth and energy for photosynthesis. This radiant energy is necessary for the metabolism of the environment and its inhabitants. Solar radiation can be captured and turned into useful forms of energy, such as heat and electricity, using a variety of technologies."
What happens when two air masses collide?,"When two different air masses collide, they don’t mix. They push against each other along a line called air front.When a warm air mass meets a cold air mass, the warm air rises as it is lighter and the water vapour in it condenses at higher altitudes. This type of front is called a warm front. It generates nimbostratus clouds, which can result in moderate rain.On the other hand, when a cold air mass catches up with a warm air mass, the cold air slides under the warm air and pushes it upward forming a cold front. As the warm air rises, it cools down rapidly giving rise to cumulonimbus clouds that are often associated with heavy precipitation and storms."
What kind of air mass is found on seas and oceans?,Maritime air mass is found on seas and oceans. Two kinds of air masses form over water. They are Maritime tropical (mT) formed over warm tropical and subtropical oceans.Maritime polar (mP) formed over the relatively cold high latitude oceans.
What does La Nina mean?,"La Nina means Little Girl in Spanish. La Nina is also sometimes called El Viejo that means anti-El Nino (simply a cold event). La Nina has the opposite effect of El Nino.La Niña is caused by a build-up of cooler-than-normal waters in the eastern tropical Pacific. During La Nina events, trade winds are even stronger than usual, pushing more warm water toward Asia.The eastern and central parts of the tropical Pacific become even colder, while the west is warmer and experiences more rainfall."
What happens during La Nina?,"During La Nina events, trade winds are even stronger than usual and push more warm water toward Asia. La Nina brings warmer-than-normal sea-surface temperatures to the southern Pacific Ocean around northern Australia, New Guinea, and the islands of Indonesia. The cooler sea-surface temperatures of La Nina occur in the southern Pacific off the coast of South America. The eastern and central parts of the tropical Pacific become even colder, while the west is warmer and experiences more rainfall.La Nina causes drought in Peru and Ecuador, heavy floods in Australia, high temperatures in Western Pacific, Indian Ocean, off the Somalian coast and good monsoon rains in India. A La Nina is actually beneficial for the Indian monsoon."
Why Coriolis force is maximum at Pole?,"The Coriolis force is directly proportional to the angle of latitude. As the latitude at which horizontally and freely moving objects are located increases, the twisting of the underlying Earth’s surface due to the planet’s rotation increases. That is the Coriolis effect increases as the latitude increases. It is maximum at the poles and is absent at the equator."
Where is the Coriolis effect weakest?,"At the equator, the Coriolis force is zero and the wind blows perpendicular to the isobars. There is no Coriolis effect because there is no turning of the surface of the Earth (sense of rotation) underneath a horizontally and freely moving object at the equator. The object’s path is straight and there is no curving of the object’s path as measured relative to Earth’s surface. The object’s path is straight."
What is meant by temperature inversion?,"Normally, temperature decreases with an increase in elevation. It is called the normal lapse rate. At times, the situation is reversed and the normal lapse rate is inverted. It is called Inversion of temperature. Inversion is usually of short duration and quite common. A long winter night with clear skies and still air is an ideal situation for inversion. "
What conditions favour a temperature inversion?,"Favourable Conditions for Temperature Inversion are:Long winter nights,Cloudless and clear sky,Dry air near the ground surface,Slow movement of air that reduces mixing of heat in the lower layers of the atmosphere.,Ground surface covered with snow that reflects insolation."
What are the types of temperature inversions?,"Surface temperature inversion: It is developed when air is cooled by contact with a colder surface until it becomes cooler than the overlying atmosphere; this occurs most often on clear nights when the ground cools off rapidly by radiation.Subsidence inversion: The air at higher altitudes becomes warmer than at lower altitudes, producing a temperature inversion. This type of temperature inversion is called subsidence inversion.Valley inversion: Cold air at the hills and mountains, produced during the night, flows under the influence of gravity. Being heavy and dense, the cold air acts almost like water and moves down the slope to pile up deeply in pockets and valley bottoms with warm air above.Frontal inversion: When the warm and cold fronts meet, then the warm front rises up and being heavier the cold front sinks down. "
What are the effects of low-level inversion?,Effects of low-level inversion:Convective clouds cannot grow high enough to produce showers.visibility may be greatly reduced below the inversion because of the accumulation of dust and smoke particles.Fog is frequently present at the base because the air near the base of an inversion tends to be cool.
What is valley inversion?,"In high mountains or deep valleys, sometimes, the temperature of the lower layers of air increases instead of decreasing with elevation along a sloping surface. Cold air at the hills and mountains, produced during the night, flows under the influence of gravity. Being heavy and dense, the cold air acts almost like water and moves down the slope to pile up deeply in pockets and valley bottoms with warm air above. This type of inversion of temperature is called valley inversion."
What do you mean by surface inversion?,"Surface temperature inversion is developed when air is cooled because of contact with a colder and becomes cooler than the overlying atmosphere. This occurs most often on clear nights when the ground cools off rapidly by radiation. If the temperature of surface air drops below its dew point, it may result in the formation of fog. It is very common in higher latitudes. In lower and middle latitudes, it occurs during cold nights and gets destroyed during the daytime."
What is an air mass?,"An air mass is a large body of air having little horizontal variation in temperature and moisture. The homogenous surfaces, over which air masses form, are called the source regions. Air masses can extend thousands of kilometres in any direction and can reach from ground level to the stratosphere. The air masses are classified according to the source regions. "
What is an air mass and how does it form?,"An air mass is a large body of air having little horizontal variation in temperature and moisture. Air masses form over large surfaces with uniform temperatures and humidity, called source regions. Low wind speeds let air remain stationary long enough to take on the features of the source region, such as heat or cold. When winds move air masses, they carry their weather conditions from the source region to a new region."
What are the characteristics of an air mass?,"It has nearly uniform conditions of temperature and humidity at any given level of altitude.It extends thousands of kilometres across the surface of the Earth and can reach from ground level to the stratosphere.When winds move air masses, they carry their weather conditions from the source region to a new region.Maritime air masses form over the water and are humid. Continental air masses form over land and are dry."
How is the atmosphere heated?,Conduction: It is a process in which heat flows from objects with higher temperatures to objects with lower temperatures. The air in contact with the land gets heated gradually and the upper layers in touch with the lower layers also get heated.Convection: Vertical heating of the atmosphere is known as convection. The air in contact with the earth upsurges vertically on heating in the form of currents and transfers the heat of the atmosphere.Advection: The transfer of heat through the horizontal movement of air is called advection. 
What type of radiation does Earth emit?,"Earth emits mostly Longwave radiation. Solar energy enters our atmosphere as shortwave radiation in the form of ultraviolet UV rays and visible light. Once in the Earth’s atmosphere, clouds and the surface absorb solar energy. The ground heats up and re-emits the energy as longwave radiation in the form of infrared rays. "
What is Coriolis force?,"Coriolis force is an apparent force caused by the earth’s rotation. The Coriolis force is responsible for deflecting winds towards the right in the northern hemisphere and towards the left in the southern hemisphere. This is also known as ‘Ferrel’s Law’.The deflection is more when the wind velocity is high. The Coriolis force acts perpendicular to the pressure gradient force. The pressure gradient force is perpendicular to an isobar. The higher the pressure gradient force, the more is the velocity of the wind and the larger is the deflection in the direction of wind."
What type of force is the Coriolis effect?,Coriolis force is an apparent force caused by the earth’s rotation.  It causes an apparent deflection of the path of an object that moves within a rotating coordinate system. It is responsible for deflecting winds towards the right in the northern hemisphere and towards the left in the southern hemisphere. This is also known as ‘Ferrel’s Law’.
What are the three types of convergent boundaries?,There are three ways in which convergence can occur. These are:Between an oceanic and continental plate.Between two oceanic plates.Between two continental plates.
What is an oxbow lake and how is it formed?,"Oxbow lake is a small lake located in an abandoned meander loop of a river channel. They are U-shaped or curved bends in a river that are cut off from the main river flow, forming a lake. Every river contains twists and turns or meanders, that cut through the surrounding landscape in a unique way. Due to continuous erosion and deposition along the sides of the meanders, the end of the meander loop comes closer and closer. In due course of time, the meander loops cut off from the river forming a lake called oxbow lake."
What is the example of an oxbow lake?,"Lake Chicot: It is the largest natural lake in the state of Arkansas and the largest oxbow lake in North America.Kanwar lake:  It is the largest freshwater oxbow lake in Asia and Bihar’s only Ramsar site, located in the Begusarai district. It is also is facing threat of running dry."
Which is the largest oxbow lake in India?,Kanwar lake is the largest oxbow lake in India and in Asia. It is a freshwater lake located in the Begusarai district and is the only Ramsar site in Bihar. It is currently facing the threat of running dry.
Where are oxbow lakes found?,"Oxbow lakes are usually formed in flat, low-lying plains close to where the river empties into another body of water. On these plains, rivers often have wide meanders. "
How is a waterfall formed?,"The process of erosion, the wearing away of earth, plays an important part in the formation of waterfalls. When a river or stream flows over hard rock (where erosion is slow) and also flows over soft rock (where erosion is more rapid), the soft rock is eroded by the water ultimately making the watercourse steeper beyond the hard rock layer. This steepening effect also accelerates erosion as the influence of gravity on the water increases the water’s speed. Eventually, the watercourse steepens until it’s either nearly vertical or completely vertical resulting in the formation of a waterfall."
What is a peneplain?,"A peneplain (an almost plain) is a low-relief plain which is formed as a result of stream erosion. It is produced by fluvial erosion that would, in the course of geologic time, reduce the land almost to base level (sea level), leaving so little gradient that essentially no more erosion could occur."
What are fluvial erosional landforms?,"Fluvial erosional landforms are the landforms created by the movement and energy associated with rivers and streams. There are two types of landforms created by the fluvial process. They are fluvial Erosional Landforms and fluvial Depositional Landforms. Fluvial Erosional Landforms: Gorges, canyons waterfalls, rapids and river capture etc.Fluvial Depositional Landforms: Floodplains, oxbow lakes, natural levees and Delta etc."
What are potholes and plunge pools?,"Potholes: Potholes are circular depressions formed because of stream erosion aided by the abrasion of rock fragments. Once a small and shallow depression forms, pebbles and boulders get collected in those depressions and get rotated by flowing water and consequently the depressions grow in dimensions.Plunge pools: Plunge pools are large, deep potholes commonly found at the foot of a waterfall. They are formed because of the sheer impact of water and the rotation of boulders. These pools also help in the deepening of valleys."
What are the two main motions of Earth?,The two main motions of Earth are rotation and revolution. Rotation is the movement of the earth on its axis. The movement of the earth around the sun in a fixed path or orbit is called Revolution.The earth takes about 24 hours to complete one rotation around its axis. The period of rotation is known as the earthday. This is the daily motion of the earth.Revolution takes 365¼ days (one year) to revolve around the sun. We consider a year as consisting of 365 days only and ignore six hours for the sake of convenience. 
Which planet is known as Earth’s twin?,"Venus is called Earth’s twin because Venus and Earth are almost the same size, have a very similar composition, and approximately have about the same mass.Some facts about venus:The planet is often called the “morning star” or “evening star” because it is visible at dawn and dusk.Venus takes the longest time to rotate around its axis, it is the longest in the solar system when compared to all other planets.Venus rotates in the opposite direction, hence the sun rises in the West and sets in the East. The opposite rotation is a distinction it shares with only one other planet i.e. Uranus.Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. Its thick atmosphere is full of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, and it has clouds of sulfuric acid."
What is the importance of heat budget?,"A heat budget is a perfect balance between incoming heat absorbed by the earth and outgoing heat escaping it in the form of radiation. Heat budget is important because it explains, why the earth neither warms up nor cools down despite the huge transfer of heat that takes place. "
What is earth's albedo?,"Albedo is the portion of solar energy reflected from the surface of the Earth back into space. It is a reflection coefficient and has a value of less than one. When solar radiation passes through the atmosphere, a certain amount of it is scattered, reflected and absorbed. The reflected sum of radiation is called the earth’s albedo. It plays an important role in the energy balance of the earth’s surface."
Do convergent boundaries form mountains?,"Yes, Convergent boundaries form mountains. Examples:The Andes Mountain Range was formed by the convergence of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American plate.The Himalayas are formed by the convergence of the Eurasian plate and the Indian plate."
What happens when two tectonic plates collide?,"When two tectonic plates collide, they form a convergent plate boundary. A convergent plate boundary such as the one between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate forms towering mountain ranges, like the Himalayas, as Earth’s crust is crumpled and pushed upward.In some cases, however, a convergent plate boundary can result in one tectonic plate diving underneath another. This process is called subduction. It involves an older, denser tectonic plate being forced deep into the planet underneath a younger, less-dense tectonic plate. When this process occurs in the ocean, a trench can be formed.When subduction occurs, a chain of volcanoes often develops near the convergent plate boundary."
Are mid-oceanic ridges divergent or convergent?,"The mid-ocean ridge system is an example of a divergent plate boundary. For example, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is formed in the Atlantic ocean because of the divergence of the North American plate from the Eurasian Plate and the South American plate from the African plate. "
What is produced in the convergence of two continental plates?,"When the two continental plates converge, oceanic sediments are squeezed and upthrust between the plates and these squeezed sediments appear as fold mountains along the plate margins. The Himalayan Mountains are an example of this type of convergent plate boundary."
Is Japan an oceanic-oceanic convergent boundary?,"No, Japan lies on the Islands formed because of convergence between a continental plate (Eurasian) and an oceanic plate (Philippine sea plate). "
What are the two main types of crust?,"Oceanic crust: Oceanic crust extends 5-10 kilometres beneath the ocean floor. It is mostly composed of different types of basalts. Geologists often refer to the rocks of the oceanic crust as sima. Sima stands for silicate and magnesium, the most abundant minerals in oceanic crust.Continental crust: Continental crust is mostly composed of different types of granites. Geologists often refer to the rocks of the continental crust as sial. Sial stands for silicate and aluminium, the most abundant minerals in the continental crust.Continental crust is almost always much older than oceanic crust. Because continental crust is rarely destroyed and recycled in the process of subduction."
Why do tectonic plates move?,"The tectonic plates move because the heat from radioactive processes within the planet’s interior causes the plates to move, sometimes toward and sometimes away from each other. This movement is called plate motion, or a tectonic shift."
What is an example of continental-continental convergence?,Examples of continent-continent convergent boundaries are:Himalaya Mountains created by the collision of the India Plate with the Eurasian Plate.Series of ranges extending from the Alps in Europe to the Zagros Mountains in Iran created by the collision of the African Plate with the Eurasian Plate.
What is an example of ocean-continent convergence?,Examples of ocean-continent convergence are:Formation of Andes Mountains and the Peru Trench because of subduction of the Nazca Plate under South America.Formation of Cascade Range because of subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate under North America.
Which tectonic plates are convergent?,"Convergent plate boundaries are formed where the crust is destroyed as one plate dived under another. The location where the sinking of a plate occurs is called a subduction zone. There are three ways in which convergence can occur. These are:Between an oceanic and continental plate,Between two oceanic plates and Between two continental plates."
How fast do tectonic plates move?,"These rates at which tectonic plates move vary considerably. The Arctic Ridge has the slowest rate (less than 2.5 cm/yr), and the East Pacific Rise near Easter Island, in the South Pacific about 3,400 km west of Chile, has the fastest rate (more than 15 cm/yr). The strips of normal and reverse magnetic fields that parallel the mid-oceanic ridges help scientists determine the rates of plate movement."
What is an example of ocean-ocean convergence?,"In ocean-ocean convergence, two oceanic plates converge or collide. The denser plate subducts into the asthenosphere below the convergence zone. Trenches are formed at the surface of ocean-ocean convergence. The location where the sinking of a plate occurs is called a subduction zone."
Is the Atlantic Ocean growing or shrinking?,"Atlantic Ocean growing by a few centimeters every year because of sea floor spreading. Seafloor spreading occurs at divergent plate boundaries as the tectonic plates slowly move away from each other. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is formed in the Atlantic ocean because of sea floor spreading. It separates the North American plate from the Eurasian plate, and the South American plate from the African plate. "
What is Ocean-continent convergence?,"Ocean-continent convergence is formed between the Oceanic plate and continental plate. At an ocean-continent convergent boundary, the denser oceanic plate is pushed under the less dense continental plate in the same manner as at an ocean-ocean boundary."
What is an example of oceanic continental convergence?,"At an ocean-continent convergent boundary, the denser oceanic plate is pushed under the less dense continental plate in the same manner as at an ocean-ocean boundary.Examples of ocean-continent convergent boundaries are Subduction of the Nazca Plate under South America which has created the Andes Mountains and the Peru Trench Subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate under North America created the Cascade Range."
What is a continent-continent convergence?,"Continent-Continent (C-C) convergence is formed between two continental plates. When the plates converge, oceanic sediments are squeezed and upthrust between the plates and these squeezed sediments appear as fold mountains along the plate margins. The Himalayan Mountains are an example of this type of convergent plate boundary."
What is seafloor spreading?,Seafloor spreading is a geologic process in which tectonic plates large slabs of Earth’s lithosphere split apart from each other. Seafloor spreading occurs along mid-ocean ridges (large mountain ranges rising from the ocean floor). The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is formed in the Atlantic ocean because of seafloor spreading. The Atlantic Ocean growing by a few centimetres every year because of seafloor spreading. 
What are the examples of destructive forces?,Examples of destructive forces are weathering and erosion. These forces tend to break down the features of the Earth’s surface.Destructive forces often result in the loss of existing types of land.
What are the exogenic processes?,"The exogenic processes derive their energy from the atmosphere determined by the ultimate energy from the sun and also the gradients created by tectonic factors. All the exogenic geomorphic processes are covered under the general term, denudation. The word ‘denude’ means to strip off or to uncover. Weathering, mass wasting/movements, erosion and transportation are included in denudation."
What is the importance of Exogenic processes?,"Exogenic processes play an important role in the formation of relief and create a variety of landscapes.Examples: Fertile flood plains, levees and deltas are formed by running waters of rivers.Sea caves, arches stacks and cliffs are formed by the work of sea waves.Mushroom rocks and sand dunes are formed by the work of wind."
What is a geomorphic process?,"The geomorphic process means bringing about changes in the configuration of the Earths surface, due to physical stresses and chemical actions on materials present on earth. The physical and chemical actions are due to endogenic and exogenic forces.Endogenic geomorphic processes: Diastrophism and volcanism.Exogenic geomorphic processes: Weathering, mass wasting, erosion and deposition."
What are the types of endogenic processes?,"This energy due to geothermal gradients and heat flow from within induces diastrophism and volcanism in the lithosphere.Diastrophism: All processes that move, elevate or build up portions of the earth’s crust come under diastrophism. They include: Orogenic processes involving mountain building through severe folding and affecting long and narrow belts of the earth’s crust; Epeirogenic processes involving uplift or warping of large parts of the earth’s crust; Earthquakes involving local relatively minor movements; Plate tectonics involving horizontal movements of crustal plates.Volcanism: Volcanism includes the movement of molten rock (magma) onto or toward the earth’s surface and also the formation of many intrusive and extrusive volcanic landforms."
What are endogenic processes?,"The endogenic process is an internal geomorphic process. The energy emanating from within the earth is the main force behind endogenic geomorphic processes. This energy is mostly generated by radioactivity, rotational and tidal friction and primordial heat from the origin of the earth. This energy due to geothermal gradients and heat flow from within induces diastrophism and volcanism in the lithosphere."
What causes endogenic processes?,"The energy emanating from within the earth is the main force behind endogenic geomorphic processes.

What are the disadvantages of plateaus?,"The main disadvantage of plateaus is the continuous erosion of their surface. Therefore, we observe the prevalence of a patchy or the slow development of agriculture and building of roads on the plateaus. This factor also explains why the plateaus are sparsely populated."
What are the different types of plains?,"Structural plains: These plains are mainly formed by the uplift of a part of the seafloor or continental shelf. These are located on the borders of almost all the major continents.Example: The southeastern plain of the United States was formed by the uplift of a part of the Gulf of Mexico.Erosional plains: These plains are formed by the continuous and long time erosion of all sorts of upland. The surface of such plains is hardly smooth. These are therefore also called peneplains which means almost a plain.Example: Canadian shield and the West Siberian plain.Depositional plains: These plains are formed by the deposition of sediments brought down by rivers, glaciers and winds. "
What are the types of seismic waves?,"Seismic waves or Earthquake waves are basically of two types. They are body waves and surface waves. Body waves: They are generated due to the release of energy at the focus and move in all directions travelling through the body of the earth. There are two types of body waves. They are called P and S-waves. P-waves move faster and are the first to arrive at the surface. These are also called primary waves. The P-waves are similar to sound waves. They travel through gaseous, liquid and solid materials. S-waves arrive at the surface with some time lag. These are called secondary waves. They can travel only through solid materials.surface waves: The body waves interact with the surface rocks and generate a new set of waves called surface waves."
How do seismic waves travel through the Earth?,"Different types of seismic waves travel in different manners. As they move or propagate, they cause vibration in the body of the rocks through which they pass.P-waves vibrate parallel to the direction of the wave. This exerts pressure on the material in the direction of the propagation. As a result, it creates density differences in the material leading to stretching and squeezing of the material.S-waves is perpendicular to the wave direction in the vertical plane. Hence, they create troughs and crests in the material through which they pass."
What are the most damaging seismic waves?,"Surface waves are considered to be the most damaging waves. These waves move along the surface. The velocity of waves changes as they travel through materials with different densities. The denser the material, the higher is the velocity. Their direction also changes as they reflect or refract when coming across materials with different densities."
What is the importance of seismic waves?,The study of seismic waves provides a complete picture of the layered interior. Seismic activity is one of the most important sources of information about the interior of the earth. It also helps us to understand and predict earthquakes and tsunamis.
How are earthquakes measured?,"The earthquake events are measured either according to the magnitude or intensity of the shock. The magnitude scale is known as the Richter scale. The magnitude relates to the energy released during the quake. The magnitude is expressed in absolute numbers ranging between 0 and 10.The intensity scale is named after Mercalli, an Italian seismologist. The intensity scale takes into account the visible damage caused by the event. The range of intensity scale is between 1 and 12."
What is the difference between S-waves and P-waves?,"P-waves: These are also called primary waves. They move faster and are the first to arrive at the surface. The P-waves are similar to sound waves. They travel through gaseous, liquid and solid materials. S-waves: These are called secondary waves. They arrive at the surface with some time lag. They can travel only through solid materials."
What are the features of a plateau?,"This landform has a large elevated area on its top. It has a large area on its top and steep slope on its side.Very often rivers or streams cut out deep valleys and gorges in a plateau region. Most of the minerals in the world are found in plateaus.Rivers falling down the edges of plateaus form waterfalls. These waterfalls provide ideal sites for generating hydel power. The higher parts of the plateaus even in tropical and sub-tropical regions have cool climates.Plateaus have large grassland areas suitable for animal-rearing especially sheep, goat and cattle."
What are the landforms found in karst regions?,"The karst topography is also characterised by erosional and depositional landforms.Erosional landforms: Pools, sinkholes, lapies, limestone pavements and caves.Depositional landforms: Stalactites, stalagmites and pillars."
What type of landform is a sinkhole?,"The sinkhole is a karst type of landform. It is an opening more or less circular at the top and funnel-shaped towards the bottom with sizes varying in area from a few sq. m to a hectare and with depth from less than half a metre to thirty metres or more. Some of these form solely through solution action (solution sinks) and others might start as solution forms first and if the bottom of a sinkhole forms the roof of a void or cave underground, it might collapse leaving a large hole opening into a cave or a void below (collapse sinks)."
What are the major types of plateaus?,Intermontane Plateaus: The plateau which is bordering the fold mountain range or are partly or fully enclosed within them are the intermontane plateaus.Piedmont Plateaus: The plateaus that are situated at the foot of the mountains and are bounded on other sides by a plain or an ocean are called the piedmont plateau. Continental Plateaus : These are formed either by an extensive continental uplift or by the spread of horizontal basic lava sheets completely covering the original topography to a great depth. 
What is the highest plateau in the world?,The Qinghai-Tibetan plateau is the highest and largest plateau in the world. The plateau is bounded by the Himalayas in the southwest and the Kunlun and Aljin mountains in the northeast. It towers over southwestern China at an average elevation of 4000 m above sea level and is known as the roof of the world.
What are the types of landslides?,"Falls: Falls are sudden movements of loads of soil, debris, and rock that break away from slopes and cliffs. It occurs as a result of mechanical weathering, earthquakes, and the force of gravity.Slides: This is a kind of mass movement whereby the sliding material breakaways from the underlying stable material.Topples: Topple failure encompasses the forward spinning and movement of huge masses of rock, debris, and earth from a slope. This type of slope failure takes place around an axis near or at the bottom of the block of rock.Flows: This type of landslide is categorized into five; earth flows, debris avalanche, debris flow, mudflows, and creep, which include seasonal, continuous and progressive."
Where are landslides most common in India?,"Landslides are most common in the hilly terrain of India. The two regions most vulnerable to landslides are the Himalayas and the Western Ghats. Compared to the Western Ghats region, the slides in the Himalayas region are huge and massive. "
What is the evidence of continental drift theory?,"The Matching of Continents: The shorelines of Africa and South America facing each other have a remarkable and unmistakable match.Rocks of Same Age Across the Oceans: The belt of ancient rocks of 2,000 million years from Brazil coast matches with those from western Africa. Tillite: The Gondwana system of sediments from India is known to have its counterparts in six different landmasses of the Southern Hemisphere. Counterparts of this succession are found in Africa, Falkland Island, Madagascar, Antarctica and Australia besides India.Placer Deposits: Rich placer deposits of gold in the Ghana coast. But there is no source rock in the region. The gold-bearing veins are in Brazil and it is obvious that the gold deposits of Ghana are derived from the Brazil plateau when the two continents lay side by side.Distribution of Fossils: Identical species of plants and animals adapted to living on land or in freshwater are found on either side of the marine barriers."
What are the types of plate boundaries?,Divergent Boundaries: New crust is generated as the plates pull away from each other. The sites where the plates move away from each other are called spreading sites. Example: Mid-Atlantic RidgeConvergent Boundaries: The crust is destroyed as one plate dived under another. The location where the sinking of a plate occurs is called a subduction zone. There are three ways in which convergence can occur. These are: Between an oceanic and continental plate; Between two oceanic plates; and Between two continental plates.Transform Boundaries: The crust is neither produced nor destroyed as the plates slide horizontally past each other.
Why was the continental drift theory rejected?,The continental drift theory was rejected because Wegener suggested that the movement responsible for the drifting of the continents was caused by pole-fleeing force and tidal force. Most scholars considered these forces to be totally inadequate. 
Who is the father of continental drift theory?,"Alfred Wegener is the father of continental drift theory. He is a German meteorologist who put forth a comprehensive argument in the form of “the continental drift theory” in 1912. This was regarding the distribution of the oceans and the continents. According to Wegener, 200 million years ago, the supercontinent, Pangaea, began to split. Pangaea first broke into two large continental masses as Laurasia and Gondwanaland forming the northern and southern components respectively. Subsequently, Laurasia and Gondwanaland continued to break into various smaller continents that exist today."
What does the Greek word Pangea mean?,"The Greek word Pangea mean which meant all earth and PANTHALASSA means all water. According to Wegener, all the continents formed a single continental mass and mega ocean surrounded the same. The supercontinent was named PANGAEA and the mega water is called PANTHALASSA."
What are the major continental plates?,Antarctica and the surrounding oceanic plate.North American (with western Atlantic floor separated from the South American plate along with the Caribbean islands) plate.South American (with western Atlantic floor separated from the North American plate along with the Caribbean islands) plate.Pacific plate.India-Australia-New Zealand plate.Africa with the eastern Atlantic floor plate.Eurasia and the adjacent oceanic plate. Some important minor plates are listed.
What is plate tectonics theory?,"The theory of plate tectonics states that the Earth’s solid outer crust, the lithosphere, is separated into plates that move over the asthenosphere, the molten upper portion of the mantle. Oceanic and continental plates come together, spread apart, and interact at boundaries all over the planet."
How is plate tectonics related to continental drift?,"In continental drift theory, Wegener had thought of all the continents to have initially existed as a supercontinent in the form of Pangaea. He argued that, around 200 million years ago, the supercontinent, Pangaea, began to split. Pangaea first broke into two large continental masses as Laurasia and Gondwanaland forming the northern and southern components respectively. But according to plate tectonics theory, continental masses, resting on the plates, have been wandering all through the geological period, and Pangaea was a result of the converging of different continental masses that were parts of one or the other plates. Scientists using the palaeomagnetic data have determined the positions held by each of the present continental landmasses in different geological periods"
What landforms are formed in the karst region?,"Landforms formed due to solution and deposition in any limestone or dolomitic region by the action of groundwater or surface water is called karst topography. The karst topography is also characterised by erosional and depositional landforms. Pools, sinkholes, lapies, limestone pavements and caves are examples of erosional landforms and stalactites, stalagmites and pillars are examples of depositional landforms in the karst region."
What is a landslide and what are its effects?,"A landslide is defined as the movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth down a slope. The following are the effects of landslides.Lead to economic decline Decimation of infrastructure, Loss of life ,Affects the beauty of landscapes Impacts river ecosystems Indirect costs, such as lost timber and fish stocks."

According to Wegener, all the continents formed a single continental mass and mega ocean surrounded the same. The supercontinent was named PANGAEA, which meant all earth. The mega-ocean was called PANTHALASSA, meaning all water. He argued that, around 200 million years ago, the supercontinent, Pangaea, began to split. Pangaea first broke into two large continental masses as Laurasia and Gondwanaland forming the northern and southern components respectively. Subsequently, Laurasia and Gondwanaland continued to break into various smaller continents that exist today. "
What are the types of soil erosion?,"Rain Drop or Splash Erosion:The erosion caused due to the impact of raindrops on soil surface leading to the destruction of the crumb structure.Sheet Erosion: It takes place on level lands after a heavy shower and the soil removal is not easily noticeable. But it is harmful since it removes the finer and more fertile topsoil.Rill Erosion: It is a form of water erosion in which the erosion takes place through numerous narrow and not so straight channels called streamlets, or head cuts.Gully Erosion: It is common on steep slopes. Gullies deepen with rainfall, cut the agricultural lands into small fragments and make them unfit for cultivation."
How can we reduce soil erosion?,"Lands with a slope gradient of 15 – 25 per cent should not be used for cultivation. If at all the land is to be used for agriculture, terraces should carefully be made. Over-grazing and shifting cultivation in many parts of India have affected the natural cover of land and given rise to extensive erosion. It should be regulated and controlled by educating villagers about the consequences.Contour bunding, Contour terracing, regulated forestry, controlled grazing, cover cropping, mixed farming and crop rotation are some of the remedial measures which are often adopted to reduce soil erosion.Efforts should be made to prevent gully erosion and control their formation. Finger gullies can be eliminated by terracing.In bigger gullies, the erosive velocity of water may be reduced by constructing a series of check dams. Special attention should be made to control the headward extension of gullies. This can be done by gully plugging, terracing or by planting cover vegetation. "
How do humans cause soil erosion?,"Human activities are also responsible for soil erosion to a great extent. As the human population increases, the demand for land also increases. Some human activities that cause soil erosion are:Agricultural activities such as clearing trees, the ploughing land to sow new seeds cause soil erosion.The grazing animals feed on the grasses and remove the vegetation from the land. They also pull out plants by their roots. This loosens the soil and makes it more prone to erosion.Logging and Mining activities also disturb the land and leave the soil more prone to erosion."
How does a tsunami happen?,"A tsunami is a Japanese word that means “Harbour waves” as the harbours get destroyed whenever there is a tsunami. An earthquake, a volcanic eruption or underwater landslides can shift large amounts of ocean water. As a result, a huge tidal wave called tsunami is formed. This force caused by large and sudden displacement of the ocean creates waves that radiate outward in all directions away from their source, sometimes crossing entire ocean basins."
Where do tsunamis occur the most?,Tsunamis occur most often in the Pacific Ocean and Indonesia because the Pacific Rim bordering the Ocean has a large number of active submarine earthquake zones. They also occur in the Mediterranean Sea region and are expected in the Caribbean Sea as well.
What is an earthquake?,"An earthquake in simple words is the shaking of the earth. It is a natural event. It is caused due to release of energy, which generates waves that travel in all directions. Earthquakes occur all the time, all over the earth. They are not even noticed. Major earthquakes are much less frequent. They can cause immense damage to buildings, bridges, dams and people. There can be a great loss to life and property. Earthquakes can cause floods, landslides and tsunamis. The point where the energy is released is called the focus of an earthquake, alternatively, it is called the hypocentre. The point on the surface, nearest to the focus, is called the epicentre. It is the first one to experience the waves."
What are the main causes of earthquakes?,"Plate tectonics: They account for most earthquakes worldwide and usually occur at the boundaries of tectonic plates.Induced quakes: They are caused by human activity, like tunnel construction, filling reservoirs and implementing geothermal or fracking projects.Volcanic quakes: They are associated with active volcanism.Collapse quakes: They can be triggered by such phenomena as cave-ins, mostly in karst areas or close to mining facilities, as a result of subsidence."
Which country has the most recorded earthquakes?,Japan has the most recorded earthquakes in the world as it sits on a highly active seismic area. Japan is near the Pacific Ring of Fire which makes it highly vulnerable to catastrophic earthquakes.
Can we predict an earthquake?,"No, we cannot predict when an earthquake will happen. Scientists can only calculate the probability that a significant earthquake will occur in a specific area within a certain number of years."
What are the main rock types?,"Igneous rocks: When the molten magma cools, it becomes solid. Rocks thus formed are called igneous rocks. They are also called primary rocks. Sedimentary rocks: These loose sediments are compressed and hardened to form layers of rocks. These types of rocks are called sedimentary rocks.Metamorphic rocks: Igneous and sedimentary rocks can change into metamorphic rocks under great heat and pressure."
How do you classify rocks?,Igneous Rocks — solidified from magma and lava; Sedimentary Rocks — the result of deposition of fragments of rocks by exogenous processes; Metamorphic Rocks — formed out of existing rocks undergoing recrystallisation.
What are the types of metamorphic rocks?,Metamorphic rocks are classified into two major groups. They are foliated rocks and non-foliated rocks.Foliated means the parallel arrangement of certain mineral grains that gives the rock a striped appearance. Example: granite gneiss and schist.Non-foliated metamorphic rocks do not have platy or sheet-like structure. Example: marble and quartzite.
What is climatology?,"Climatology is the scientific study of climate. It is a branch of the atmospheric sciences concerned with the description of the climate, the analysis of the causes of climatic differences and changes and their practical consequences."
How are the landforms formed?,"Landforms are features on the Earth’s surface that make up the terrain, such as mountains, valleys, plains or plateaus. Landforms are formed by both endogenic and exogenic forces.Endogenic forces: Sudden forces like earthquakes, volcanoes, and landslides.Exogenic forces: Erosional and depositional landforms formed because of agents like water, wind, sea waves and glaciers."
What are the causes of soil erosion?,"Higher intensity of rainfall and flooding causes rill erosion, gully erosion, sheet erosion and splash erosion.The agricultural activities disturb the ground. Most of the crops are grown during the spring season, the land lies fallow during winters. Most of the soil is eroded during winters.Overgrazing of animals removes the vegetation from the land which in turn causes erosion.Logging and mining activities also disturb the land and leave the soil more prone to erosion.The construction of roads and buildings.The flowing rivers and streams carry away the soil particles leading to erosion."
What are the erosional landforms formed by rivers?,"River valleys, waterfalls, structural benches, river terraces, river meanders, ox-bow lakes and peneplains are some examples of erosional landforms formed by rivers. "
What are the types of landforms?,"A landform is a feature on the Earth’s surface that is part of the terrain. Mountains, hills, plateaus, and plains are the four major types of landforms. Buttes, canyons, valleys, and basins are examples of minor landforms."
What landforms are created by groundwater?,"The results of the work of groundwater cannot be seen in all types of rocks. But in rocks like limestones or dolomites rich in calcium carbonate, the surface water as well as groundwater through the chemical process of solution and precipitation deposition develop varieties of landforms. Any limestone or dolomitic region showing typical landforms produced by the action of groundwater through the processes of solution and deposition is called Karst topography. The karst topography is also characterised by erosional and depositional landforms. Erosional Landforms: pools, sinkholes, lapies and caves.Depositional Landforms: stalactites, stalagmites and pillars."
What are the landforms created by deposition?,"Running water: Alluvial Fans, deltas, meanders, braided channels,Groundwater: Stalactites, stalagmites, pillars, Glaciers: Moraines, eskers, outwash plains, drumlinsWaves and currents: Beaches and dunes, bars, barriers and spits.Winds: Sand dunes"
How are aeolian landforms formed?,"Aeolian landforms are shaped by the wind. Various erosional and depositional landforms are created by the action of wind.Erosional landforms: pediments, pediplains, playas, deflation Hollows, caves, mushroom, table rocks and pedestal rocks.Depositional landforms: sand Dunes "
Is the waterfall an erosional landform or depositional landform?,Waterfall is an erosional landform. The running water in the river erodes the landscape. When the river tumbles at a steep angle over very hard rocks or down a steep valley side it forms a waterfall.
What is a drainage pattern?,"Depending on the slope of the land, underlying rock structure as well as the climatic conditions of the area, the streams within a drainage basin form certain drainage patterns. These patterns are of different types like dendritic, trellis, rectangular, and radial."
What is the most common drainage pattern?,"The dendritic pattern is the most common drainage pattern. It develops where the river channel follows the slope of the terrain. The stream with its tributaries resembles the branches of a tree, thus the name dendritic."
What is a trellis drainage pattern?,"A river joined by its tributaries, at approximately right angles, develops a trellis pattern. A trellis drainage pattern develops where hard and soft rocks exist parallel to each other."
What are erosional landforms?,"Erosion is the wearing away of the landscape by different agents like water, wind and ice. Different landforms created on the surface of the earth because of erosion are called erosional landforms. Valleys, potholes, entrenched Meanders and river Terraces are some examples of erosional landforms. "
What are the erosional and depositional landforms?,"Erosion is the wearing away of the landscape by different agents like water, wind and ice. The eroded material is carried away or transported by water, wind, etc. and eventually deposited. Landforms created because of erosion are called erosional landforms and landforms created because of deposition are called depositional landforms. Erosional landforms: Valleys, potholes, entrenched Meanders and river Terraces.Depositional landforms: Alluvial Fans, deltas, meanders and braided channels."
What happens when Westerlies and easterlies meet?,"The westerlies meet easterlies from the polar highs at about 60° N. and S. When Westerlies and easterlies meet, a polar front is formed. The cool polar air meets the warmer mid-latitude air near the 60th parallel, where the warmer air rises over the colder air. This zone is known as the polar front."
What is the Arctic circle?,"Arctic Circle is a latitude around the Earth, at approximately 66°30′ N. North pole lies in Arctic circle. The North Pole is inclined towards the sun and the places beyond the Arctic Circle experience continuous daylight for about six months. The climate inside the Arctic Circle is generally cold."
Which countries are in the Arctic Circle?,"The Arctic region covers parts of eight countries. They are Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, and the United States. These countries promote collaboration, coordination, and interaction via an intergovernmental forum called the Arctic Council."
What are the types of drainage patterns?,"Dendritic pattern: This pattern develops where the river channel follows the slope of the terrain. The stream with its tributaries resembles the branches of a tree, thus the name dendritic.Trellis pattern: A river joined by its tributaries, at approximately right angles, develops a trellis pattern. A trellis drainage pattern develops where hard and soft rocks exist parallel to each other.Rectangular pattern: A rectangular drainage pattern develops on a strongly jointed rocky terrain.Radial pattern:  It develops when streams flow in different directions from a central peak or dome-like structure."
What animals live in the Arctic?,"Animal life in the Arctic, compared with that of warmer parts, is poor in the number of species but often rich in individual numbers because of polar climate. The animals that live in the Arctic region include the polar bear, caribou, arctic wolf, arctic fox, arctic weasel, arctic hare, brown and collared lemmings, ptarmigan, gyrfalcon, and snowy owl."
What are the characteristics of westerlies?,"They blow in the middle latitudes between 35 and 65 degrees latitude.They blow from the subtropical high-pressure belts towards sub-polar low-pressure belts.The winds blow from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere.The westerlies of the Southern hemisphere are more robust and constant than the westerlies of the Northern hemisphere.They play an important role in carrying the warm, equatorial waters and winds to the western coasts of continents."
What is the impact of westerlies on Europe?,"The westerlies have a greater climatic influence in western Europe because the west coast is constantly exposed to predominant westerly winds. In winter westerlies bring in warm tropical air from the southwest warming up the weather conditions. In Mediterranean Europe, the rain-bearing westerlies chiefly affect the western areas."
What are easterlies and westerlies?,"Easterlies: There are two types of easterlies. They are Polar easterlies: They are dry and cold prevailing winds that blow from the east. They emanate from the polar highs, areas of high pressure around the North and South Poles. Polar easterlies flow to low-pressure areas in sub-polar regions.Trade winds: They are the powerful prevailing winds that blow from the east across the tropics. Trade winds are also known as tropical easterlies. They start blowing from the sub-tropical high-pressure areas towards the equatorial low-pressure belt. Westerlies: Westerlies are the Permanent winds that blow in the middle latitudes. They blow from the subtropical high-pressure belts towards sub-polar low-pressure belts. The westerlies of the Southern hemisphere are more robust and constant than the westerlies of the Northern hemisphere."
Which winds are called easterlies?,"Polar easterlies: They are dry and cold prevailing winds that blow from the east. They emanate from the polar highs, areas of high pressure around the North and South Poles. Polar easterlies flow to low-pressure areas in sub-polar regions.Tropical easterlies: They are the powerful prevailing winds that blow from the east across the tropics. They are also known as trade winds. They start blowing from the sub-tropical high-pressure areas towards the equatorial low-pressure belt. "
Why are tropical easterlies called trade winds?,The tropical easterlies were named as trade winds by the crews of sailing ships that depended on the winds during westward ocean crossings. The trade winds and associated ocean currents helped early sailing ships from European and African ports make their journeys to the Americas.
What do easterlies mean?,Easterlies mean winds blowing from the east.The name of the permanent winds comes from the direction of their origin. Polar easterlies are dry and cold prevailing winds that blow from the east. Trade winds are the powerful prevailing winds that blow from the east across the tropics. As these winds blow from east towards west. Hence they are called easterlies.
What are the types of winds?,"Permanent winds – The trade winds, westerlies and easterlies are the permanent winds. These blow constantly throughout the year in a particular direction.Seasonal winds – These winds change their direction in different seasons. For example monsoons in India.Local winds – These blow only during a particular period of the day or year in a small area. For example, land and sea breeze. "
Which is the largest volcano in the world?,"Mauna Loa in Hawaii is the largest active volcano in the world. The Hawaiian shield volcanoes are the largest mountains on Earth. Mauna Loa eruptions tend to produce voluminous, fast-moving lava flows that can impact communities on the east and west sides of the Island of Hawaiʻi. Since the mid-19th century, the city of Hilo in east Hawaiʻi has been threatened by seven Mauna Loa lava flows."

Does volcanic ash cool the Earth?,"Yes, volcanic ash that is released into the atmosphere during an eruption shade sunlight and causes temporary cooling. These particles are tiny and very light that they can stay in the stratosphere for months and blocks sunlight. Thus causing cooling over large areas of the Earth."
What is an ocean current?,"Ocean currents are streams of water flowing constantly on the ocean surface in definite directions. The ocean currents may be warm or cold. Generally, the warm ocean currents originate near the equator and move towards the poles. The cold currents carry water from polar or higher latitudes to tropical or lower latitudes. The ocean current influence the temperature conditions of the area."
What energy causes ocean currents?,"Heating by solar energy causes the water to expand. That is why near the equator the ocean water is about 8 cm higher in level than in the middle latitudes. This causes a very slight gradient and water tends to flow down the slope. Other factors that influence ocean currents are wind, gravity and the coriolis force."
What are westerlies?,Westerlies are the Permanent winds that blow in the middle latitudes. They blow from the subtropical high-pressure belts towards sub-polar low-pressure belts. The westerlies of the Southern hemisphere are more robust and constant than the westerlies of the Northern hemisphere.
Why are mid-latitudinal winds called westerlies?,"At mid-latitudes, the permanent winds blow from the west towards the east direction. The name of these permanent winds comes from the direction of their origin. Hence, they are called the westerlies."

What are longitudes and latitudes?,"The latitudes and longitudes are commonly referred to as geographical coordinates. They provide a systematic network of lines upon which the position of various surface features of the earth, can be represented. With the help of these coordinates, the location, distance and direction of various points can be easily determined.Latitudes: All parallel circles from the equator up to the poles are called parallels of latitudes. Latitudes are measured in degrees.Longitudes: The vertical lines running north-south, join the two poles. They are called the meridians of longitude. They are spaced farthest apart at the equator and converge at a point at each pole."
What are the two main longitudes?,"The two main longitudes are the Prime Meridian and the 180° meridian. The two longitudes divide the earth into two equal halves, the Eastern Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere. Therefore, the longitude of a place is followed by the letter E for the east and W for the west. The 180° East and 180° West meridians are on the same line."
How do you read latitude?,"All parallels north of the equator are called north latitudes and all parallels south of the equator are called south latitudes. The value of each latitude is followed by either the word north or south. Generally, this is indicated by the letter ‘N’ or ‘S’. For example, both Chandrapur in Maharashtra (India) and Belo Horizonte in Brazil (South America) are located on parallels of about 20° latitude. But the former is 20° north of the equator and the latter is 20° south of it. We, therefore, say that Chandrapur is situated at 20° N latitude and Belo Horizonte is situated at 20° S latitude."
What are the important latitudes?,"The important parallels of latitudes are:The equator (0°),The North Pole (90°N) ,The South Pole (90° S),Tropic of Cancer (23½° N) in the Northern Hemisphere. ,Tropic of Capricorn (23½° S) in the Southern Hemisphere. ,Arctic Circle at 66½° north of the equator. ,Antarctic Circle at 66½° south of the equator."
Where is the Earth's magnetic field the strongest?,Earth’s magnetic field is strongest at the poles and weakest at the equator. The Earth’s magnetic field resembles that of an enormous bar magnet. The field lines emerge from the south pole of the earth and re-enter in the north pole.
Where is the weakest magnetic field on Earth?,The magnetic field varies in strength over the earth’s surface. The Earth’s magnetic field is weakest at the equator and strongest at the poles. 
Where are the two main hemispheric jet streams located?,Polar jet stream and a Subtropical jet stream are the two main hemispheric jet streams. The polar jet streams form between the latitudes of 50 and 60 degrees north and south of the equator. The subtropical jet stream is located around 30° N.
What is a cyclone in simple words?,The wind circulation around a low is called cyclonic circulation. A cyclone is any large system of winds that circulates about a centre of low atmospheric pressure in a counterclockwise direction north of the Equator and in a clockwise direction to the south. 
What causes a tropical cyclone?,"Tropical cyclones originate and intensify over warm tropical oceans. The conditions favourable for the formation and intensification of tropical storms are:Large sea surface with a temperature higher than 27° C;Presence of the Coriolis force;Small variations in the vertical wind speed;A pre-existing weak low-pressure area or low-level-cyclonic circulation;Upper divergence above the sea level system.When the air rises up and away from the ocean surface, it creates an area of lower air pressure below. It causes the air from surrounding areas with higher pressure to move towards the low-pressure area which further leads to warming up of the air and causes it to rise above. The moist air rises and cools the water in the air forming clouds. The complete system of clouds and wind spins and grows. More air rushes to the centre and this cycle is repeated. The chain of events ends with the formation of a very low-pressure system with very high-speed winds revolving around it. It is this weather condition that we call a cyclone. "
What is a cyclone? What are the different types of cyclones?,"A cyclone is any large system of winds that circulates about a centre of low atmospheric pressure in a counterclockwise direction north of the Equator and in a clockwise direction to the south. The two main types are the tropical cyclone and the extratropical cyclone. Extratropical cyclones develop in the mid and high latitudes, beyond the tropics. Tropical cyclones originate and intensify over warm tropical oceans."
What are the effects of cyclones?,"Seawater enters the low-lying coastal areas, causing severe loss of life and property. It also reduces the fertility of the soil. Continuous heavy rainfall may further worsen the flood situation.High-speed winds accompanying a cyclone can damage houses, telephones and other communication systems, trees, etc., causing tremendous loss of life and property."

What causes jet streams?,"Jet streams are formed when warm air masses meet cold air masses in the atmosphere. When Earth’s warmer air masses meet cooler air masses, the warmer air rises up higher in the atmosphere while cooler air sinks down to replace the warm air. This movement creates an air current or wind. A jet stream is a type of air current that forms high in the atmosphere."
How do jet streams affect the Indian climate?,"Westerly Jetstream brings the western cyclonic disturbances(originate over the Mediterranean Sea) that enter the Indian subcontinent from the west and the northwest during the winter months. An increase in the prevailing night temperature generally indicates an advance in the arrival of these cyclones disturbances.An easterly jet stream, called the sub-tropical easterly jet stream blows over peninsular India, approximately over 14°N during the summer months. Tropical cyclones occur during the monsoon as well as in October – November and are part of the easterly flow. These disturbances affect the coastal regions of the country. "
Why do jet streams flow from west to east?,Jet streams flow west to east in both the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemispherebecause of Earth’s rotation. 
Do planes fly in the jet stream?,"Yes, Planes fly in the jet stream. An airplane flying a route from west to east can generally make the trip faster than an aeroplane travelling the same route east to west. This is because the jetstreams usually move from west to east."
What happens if the jet stream stops?,"If the jetstreams stop, the whole pattern of global temperatures would change. The air cools much more gradually across the latitudes. The striking temperature difference between the equator and poles would be gone. This can cause the melting of ice in the polar regions, rise in sea level, global warming etc."

What is the difference between Equilux and Equinox?,"Equinox – The term equinox means “equal night,” when day and night are supposedly an equal length of 12 hours each.On the equinox, the length of day and night are only nearly equal. This is because the Sun appears as a disk in the sky, and the top half rises above the horizon before the centre. As well as this sunlight is refracted by the Earth’s atmosphere. The Sun, therefore, appears to rise before its centre at the horizon, giving more daylight than you might expect.Equilux – The equilux is when day and night are equal and occurs a few days before the spring equinox, and a few days after the autumn equinox. This means that the time when day and night are actually equal happens before the equinox."

Ozone layer depletion is a major phenomenon in which part of the atmosphere?,"Ozone layer depletion occurs in the stratosphere. It is that region of atmosphere from about 12-50 km above the earth’s surface.Ozone layer depletion refers to the thinning of the Ozone layer.Ozone is produced in the upper stratosphere by short-wave sunlight. Substances containing bromine and chlorine are correlated with the decrease in stratospheric ozone. When these molecules come in contact with ozone, they destroy the ozone molecules.Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) are primarily responsible for the depletion of the Ozone layer. Substances like Carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform, halons, and methyl bromide are also Ozone depleting substances.The ozone layer prevents the entry of harmful wavelengths of Ultraviolet rays from reaching the Earth’s surface.This can result in harmful health hazards like skin cancer, sunburn, cataracts, etc.Montreal Protocol of 1987 aims to protect the ozone layer by phasing out ozone-depleting substances.Charles Fabry and Henri Buisson discovered the Ozone layer in 1913."
Which gas is the main pollutant responsible for global warming?,"Carbon dioxide is the main pollutant responsible for global warming.Carbon dioxide acts like a covering and traps the incoming solar radiation from the Earth. Thus, it absorbs the heat energy that should have been emitted into space. It is responsible for 80% of global warming.The pollutants responsible for trapping the heat include methane, nitrous oxide, water vapour, and carbon dioxide. They are known as greenhouse gases.A part of the emitted heat energy is sent back to earth, which results in increased heating of the earth.Carbon dioxide, being an abundant greenhouse gas, is released into the atmosphere by industrial and human activities. Coal, natural gas, oil, solid waste, and trees, are all major contributors to the greenhouse effect."

What are the disadvantages of acid rain?,"Acid rain affects the freshwater ponds and lakes and destroys aquatic life, as some species of fishes are rare and may be extinct.It can damage historical monuments and buildings. The buildings can be found with sulphuric acid.A major consequence of more acidic water is its retention of aluminium, which can poison forests.Soil can be affected by acid rain and can lead to the deaths of good microbes. By depriving the soil of the essential nutrient and calcium, acidic rain makes it harder for plants to absorb water from the soil.It can affect the trees, particularly those that are at high altitudes."
Is acid rain natural or man made?,"Acid rain is linked to both natural and man-made sources.When a thunderstorm produces lightning,  nitrogen oxides are formed through the extreme heating of air.Sulphurous gases are discharged from erupted volcanoes and rotting vegetation.Man-made sources of acid rain include the burning of any fuel that contains sulphur and nitrogen compounds, including public utilities, industrial broilers, motor vehicles, and chemical plants."
What are man-made causes of acid rain?,"Chemical gas emissions such as sulphur and nitrogen due to any human activities are the primary contributors to acid rain.Use of coal or burning of fossil fuels for electrical power generation.Automobiles and factories release high scores of gaseous emissions.Oil refineries and manufacturing industries increase the atmospheric concentration of sulphur and nitrogen gases.These gases react in the atmosphere with water, oxygen, and other chemicals to form various acidic compounds such as sulphuric acid, ammonium nitrate, and nitric acid. As a result, these areas experience exceedingly high amounts of acid rain."

Why is urban waste disposal a serious problem in India?,"Concentration of industrial units in and around urban centres gives rise to disposal of industrial wastes.The dumping of wastes, industrial or otherwise, will render water bodies around urban areas usable.Lack of suitable dumping grounds due to high population density.Inefficient waste management policies on the part of the municipal authorities concerned."
What is the best way to reduce urban waste?,"The best way to reduce waste is to adopt proper waste management policies. This includes avoid sending wastes for incerenation instead of landfills. Since incarnation itself can cause air pollution later on, bio-waste facilities must be set up.Another way to curb waste is to reduce, reuse, recycle and dump only those waste which cannot be recycled or reused."
What steps should be taken to minimize the urban waste?,"Avoid the use of plastic bags for grocery or allied uses.Reduce, reuse and recycle as often as possible.Segregate plastic wastes from wet wastes.Out of these segregation of wastes will go a long way in reducing the amount of urban wastes that is generated on a daily basis."
What long term effects are there if oceans become more acidic?,"If oceans become more acidic, it will affect marine species such as corelas, planktons molluscs etc. The shells and skeletons of these species will be weak or less dense and as for coral leafs, they will be more vulnerable to damage from storms and their recovery rate will reduce drastically.In addition the physiology of fishes will be affected as it will increase acidity in body fluids and tissues. This in turn will cause long-term effects on metabolic functions, growth and reproduction."
How is the waste of a city disposed of?,"The waste of the city is disposed of by different methods such as landfills, open dumps, compost facilities, and incineration plants.Segregation of wastes is by far the most effective method of disposing of wastes in cities. The most persistent problem regarding waste disposal in cities is the lack of proper dumping areas on account of high population density."
What happens if oceans acidify?,"If oceans acidify to a great extent, then it will affect many species of aquatic life such as shellfish, oysters etc. They won’t be able to form strong shells or skeletons which may lead to a decline in their population in the long run.This in turn will lead to a decline in commercial fishing because acidification harms calcifying organisms which form the base of the aquatic food chain."
What are the solutions for solid waste disposal?,"One of the best solutions for solid waste disposal is recycling. In this process waste is converted into a new or usable product, preventing waste disposal in the process. There are other methods such as landfill and incineration plants.But both have environmental consequences. Landfills cause water pollution and are restricted to the availability of land, while incineration plants can cause air pollution."
What are some solutions for ocean acidification?,"Reducing greenhouse gas emissions: Reducing greenhouse gases will mean less concentration of carbon dioxide in the oceans, in turn less chances of ocean acidification.Geoengineering: Geoengineering means large-scale intervention to reverse the earth’s climate. Although it is a proposed method for ocean acidification.

What causes ocean acidification?,"Ocean acidification is caused by carbon dioxide gas dissolving into the ocean. It lowers the water’s pH, making it more acidic. The main cause of high concentrations of carbon dioxide is due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal oil etc.The increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will lead to more instances of ocean acidification."
What is ocean acidification and why is it a problem?,"Ocean acidification is the process by which a massive amount of carbon dioxide is absorbed by the ocean which reduces the water’s pH levels, thus making it more acidic in the process.Ocean acidification reduces the amount of carbonate which is necessary for the maintenance of seawater. The ocean acidification makes it difficult for marine animals such as planktons and corlas to form shells and skeletons, thus affecting the marine food web to a great extent."
What animals are affected by ocean acidification?,Marine animals such as plankton and crab oysters are affected by ocean acidification. These marine animals are unable to form shells and skeletons that impair their survival.The destruction of the planktons will affect the aquatic ecosystem as their primary consumers will not be able to sustain themselves and die out as a result.
What are the effects of ocean acidification on humans?,"Ocean acidification can modify the abundance and chemical composition of harmful algal blooms in such a way that shellfish toxicity increases and, therefore, human health is negatively affected."
What are the long term effects of ocean acidification?,"Ocean acidification reduces the amount of carbonate, a key building block in seawater. This makes it more difficult for marine organisms, such as coral and some plankton, to form their shells and skeletons, and existing shells may begin to dissolve."
Is ocean acidification related to global warming? ,"Yes, scientists have pointed out that ocean acidification is related to global warming as fuel emissions increase carbon dioxide that lead to acidification in the oceans. Conversely, increased ocean acidification may amplify global warming.Ocean acidification will hinder aquatic ecosystems and dent the oceans ability to absorb carbon dioxide."
What are some examples of ocean acidification?,"Certain marine animals like the sea urchin and oysters will not develop properly at their larvae stage when ocean acidity is increased.Some species of fish larvae will even lose their ability to smell and avoid predators, this vulnerability will mean that they may not be able to reach adulthood, thus affecting the aquatic ecosystem."
Does phytoplankton produce oxygen?,"Phytoplankton produces oxygen like every other plant through the means of photosynthesis. In fact, most half of earth’s oxygen comes from oceanic phytoplankton.Like the terrestrial plants, phytoplanktons are essential to aquatic life and a vital part of the oceanic food chain."

What does phytoplankton do for humans?,"Phytoplankton offers a broad spectrum of minerals that come from the sea – magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, iron and zinc.In addition it also produces oxygen just like plants on the land. In other words it can be said that plants are not the only source of oxygen but phytoplanktons also produce as much oxygen, if not more, than plants."
What are chlorofluorocarbons responsible for?,"Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) are responsible for the depletion of the Ozone layer. The Ozone Layer helps keep out harmful UV rays that can otherwise cause skin cancer in humans and burn plants.CFCs cause chemical reactions that cause the ozone molecules to break down, thus reducing its UV absorption capability."
Can humans consume phytoplankton?,"Yes, humans can consume phytoplankton. It is consumed as a supplement. Phytoplankton is a good source of omega 3s, and omega 3s are known to have numerous health benefits to humans.Phytoplanktons are similar to terrestrial plants in the sense that they can absorb sunlight and produce oxygen through photosynthesis."
How do CFCs destroy the ozone layer?,"When chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) drift upwards towards the stratosphere, they come in contact with the Ozone layer. This leads to a chemical reaction where the CFC molecules are broken up by ultraviolet radiation, releasing chlorine atoms, which are able to destroy ozone molecules.The destruction of the ozone layer leads to increased chances of skin cancer among humans and reduced plant health which is especially true for agricultural crops."
What exactly is phytoplankton?,"Phytoplankton are microscopic organisms that inhabit both fresh and salty water. Like terrestrial plants, phytoplankton is capable of absorbing sunlight and producing oxygen.Phytoplankton is an essential part of the aquatic ecosystem. They generate about half the atmosphere’s oxygen, as much per year as all land plants."
What are examples of CFC usage?,"Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are used in Refrigerators, Air Conditioners, Aircrafts and Aerosol sprays.The usage of these items releases a large number of CFC molecules which break down the Ozone layer, thus limiting its ability to absorb harmful UV rays."

Is CFC harmful to humans?,"In lesser amounts, CFC is not at all harmful to humans but at a higher dosage it can affect the heart, central nervous system, liver, kidneys and lungs. Extremely high levels of CFC can be fatal to humans.The CFC affects humans indirectly too as its excessive dosage is destroying the Ozone layer which in turn increases the chances of global warming and has wider health implications."
Are chlorofluorocarbons responsible for global warming?,"Along with destroying the Ozone layer, chlorofluorocarbons trap heat in the lower levels of the atmosphere. This leads to the heating of the earth and causes changes in the weather pattern.Regardless of this factor, it has been generally agreed by environmental groups that CFCs contribution to global warming has been relatively small."
Does methane destroy the ozone layer?,"Methane has destructive effects on the ozone layer. Not only that, a sharp increase in methane in the atmosphere will likely increase global warming.Methane has more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere."
How high can a snow leopard jump?,"Snow Leopards are known to jump upto 9 metres which is 6 times more than their body length.Snow leopards are native to the mountain ranges of Central and South Asia.It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because the global population is estimated to number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals.Their numbers are believed to decline further due to habitat loss and poaching."
Why are chlorofluorocarbons so good as refrigerants?,"Chlorofluorocarbons have properties that are non-flammable, tasteless and odourless while being chemically stable. Another ideal property is that hey have boiling points close to zero degrees Centigrade making them ideal for use as refrigerants in, air conditioners, freezers and refrigerators.It is the use in these items that CFC is contributing to the depletion of the Ozone layer with dangerous implications for the earth and human beings in general."
Where do snow leopards sleep at night?,"Snow leopards have preference for broken terrain cliffs, rocky outcrops and ravines as such hatates provide excellent cover and allow them to stalk and sneak up on their prey.Snow leopards do not stick to one location and they keep moving across different ranges to hunt and mark their territories to prevent the entry of rivals. Snow leopards travel along ridge lines and cliff bases, and choose bedding sites with good views over the surrounding terrain."

Is phytoplankton a plant or animal?,"The phytoplankton is a plant different from its animal counterpart, the zooplankton. Phytoplankton are similar to terrestrial plants in that they contain chlorophyll and require sunlight in order to live and grow.Phytoplankton are usually found along coastlines. Winds play a strong role in the distribution of phytoplankton because they drive currents that cause deep water, loaded with nutrients, to be pulled up to the surface."
How many wetlands are in India?,India has about 46 wetlands. The largest is the Sundarban wetlands of west bengal which is 4230 sq kms. Four wetlands have recently been recognised under the 1971 Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. They were Thol and Wadhwana from Gujarat and Sultanpur and Bhindawas from Haryana.
What is the purpose of phytoplankton?,"Phytoplankton form the foundation of the food web for most marine life. They are responsible for half of the photosynthetic activity on earth, making them important to both their local and the global ecosystems.They also provide an essential ecological function for all aquatic life."
Who eats phytoplankton?,"Phytoplankton is primarily consumed by zooplankton, small fish, and crustaceans. These in turn are consumed by fish, small sharks, corals, and baleen whales.They also provide an essential ecological function for all aquatic life."
What causes a phytoplankton bloom?,"Phytoplankton blooms happen when sunlight and additional nutrients are readily and abundantly available to the plants in the environment. These plants grow and reproduce up to a point where their presence is so dense that it changes the colour of the water they live in.Other factors influence phytoplankton growth rates, including water temperature and salinity,water depth and the number of primary consumers present in the aquatic environment."
What would happen if there was no phytoplankton?,"A sudden disappearance of phytoplankton would lead to the complete collapse of the aquatic ecosystem. In addition, if all the plankton disappeared it would increase the levels of carbon in our air, thus further accelerating climate change."

It is placed in the critically endangered category of the IUCN."
What is the smallest bird of India?,"The smallest bird of India is the Flowerpecker. The flowerpeckers are a family, Dicaeidae, of passerine birds. Some species of the Flowepeckers are vulnerable due to habitat loss.Flowerpackers get the name because flower nectar forms part of the diet, although they also take berries, spiders and insects."
Is Dodo extinct?,"The Dodo is an extinct species of flightless birds that primarily inhabited the island of Mauritius, located in the Indian Ocean.It was earlier believed that excessive hunting by humans was the cause of the Dodo’s extinction, but recent studies show that human activities along with the introduction of animals, including dogs, pigs, cats, rats, and crab-eating macaques destroyed the Dodos habitat and nesting ground.It assumed that Dodo became extinct around the year 1662, although sightings were reported around the 19th century as well. Still the year 1662 is widely accepted as the year of Dod’s extinction."
What kills snow leopards?,Snow leopards are killed by humans either through hunting or retaliatory killings when they attack humans or livestock.Snow leopards are endangered animals that live in the mountains of Asia. Poaching threatens the snow leopard because people use the leopards for fur and to make medicines.
How rare is a snow leopard?,"There are about 10,000 mature snow leopards in the world.The numbers could be higher or lower as the species is not easy to detect due to their distinct fur blending with the snow and they tend to live in those reaches of their mountain environments that are not easily accessible to humans."
What is the lifespan of a snow leopard?,"In captivity, the lifespan of a snow leopard is 22 years. In the wild, because of the harsh environment, a snow leopard’s life span may be anything between 10 to 12 years.Some snow leopards have also lived upto 25 years in captivity. Snow leopards are native to the mountain ranges of Central Asia and South Asia, a region known for its harsh winters and mountain ranges."

What is the difference between Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient?,The main difference between the Gini coefficient and the Lorenz Curve is that the Gini coefficient helps in measuring the degree of income inequality and the Lorenz curve helps in understanding the distribution of income or wealth in an economy.
What is the Gini Coefficient?,"The Gini coefficient is used to measure income inequality across a population. It was developed by Corrado Gini, an Italian statistician, in 1912. It is measured on a scale of 0 to 1. Perfect inequality is represented by 1 and perfect equality is represented by 0.A higher Gini index indicates that the income inequality is higher, indicating that higher percentage of the total income of the population is in the hands of the individuals with very high-income."
What is the importance of the Lorenz curve?,The Lorenz curve is important because it helps in understanding economic inequality. When the lorenz curve keeps moving away from the baseline it indicates that the level of unequal distribution keeps increasing.The Lorenz curve was developed by Max O. Lorenz in 1905.
What shifts the Lorenz curve?,"When the unequal distribution of income keeps increasing, the lorenz curve keeps shifting away from the line of equality. The Lorenz curve was developed by Max O. Lorenz in 1905.When the lorenz curve shifts farther away from the line of equality, the gini coefficient keeps increasing. When the lorenz curve is closer to the line of equality, the gini coefficient is lower, meaning the unequal distribution of income or wealth is lower."
How do you read a Lorenz curve?,"The Y-axis represents the income, and the X-axis represents the population. The percentage of wealth or income owned by a percentage of the population can be identified from any point in the Lorenz Curve. The Lorenz curve is not only used for studying income inequality but also other systems. The Gini index is measured from the Lorenz curve.If the Lorenz curve is shifting far away from the line of equality then it indicates that the income inequality is higher and the gini coefficient is higher. If the lorenz curve is closer to the line of equality then it indicates that the gini coefficient is lower and income inequality is lower."
Where do we apply the Lorenz curve?,"The Lorenz curve is applied to find the income inequality in a population. The area between the curve and the equality line is the gini coefficient. The Gini index is used to compare the economic, income inequality of different nations.If the gini coefficient is higher then it implies the income inequality is higher. If the gini coefficient is lower then it implies that the income inequality is lower."
What is a limitation of Lorenz curves?,"If two Lorenz Curves intersect, it is not possible to determine which distribution has more inequality. In the lifetime of an individual, there will be variation in income and this variation is not taken into consideration when inequality in the Lorenz Curves is analyzed. These are the limitations of the Lorenz Curves."
What is a regressive tax?,"Applying uniform tax on a large percentage of low income earners than on high income earners is known as regressive tax.

As a result companies will start reducing the prices of goods as services.Japan had experienced deflation in the 1990s, and the United States of America had experienced deflation in the 1930s. The decline in prices can also be caused by tighter monetary policy of central banks, failure in the stock markets, reduction in government spending."

When does deflation occur?,"Deflation occurs in the economy when the prices of goods and services start falling. This happens due to reduced demand for the goods and services which results in reduction of prices and goods.In the short-term, deflation will increase the buying power of the consumers, and increase their savings. Deflation will reduce the circulation of money in the economy."
How to control deflation?,"Deflation can be controlled by using various monetary policy measures. Quantitative easing, cutting tax rates, lowering interest rates, open market operations, lowering bank reserve limits, increasing spending by the Government are the ways in which deflation can be controlled."
Why is deflation worse than inflation?,"Deflation is worse than inflation because deflation is an indication that the economy is not growing. The prices of goods and services fall down due to low demand in the market. This results in companies reducing their production which will lead to reduction in employee salaries and layoffs.Deflation will impact the economic growth of a country because it will impact the investment, production and employment."
Why are inflation and deflation considered to be economic problems?,"Deflation is definitely an economic problem because the lower prices completely impacts the growth of the economy. It will lead to reduced investments, production and lead to more unemployment.High rate of inflation is an economic problem because the demand for goods and services will reduce drastically, the buying power of people will reduce massively. Inflation at a healthy rate is good for the country’s economy. The Central Bank – RBI uses various monetary policy instruments to control inflation."
Which is better: inflation or deflation?,"Inflation is better than deflation. Deflation completely ruins the economy, whereas moderate levels of inflation helps in the growth of the economy, it leads to more investments, production and employment.Deflation on the other hand, leads to loss of production, investments, and leads to unemployment."
What are the effects of deflation?,"Deflation reduces production of goods and services due to reduction in demand for goods and services from the consumers. Reduction in production of goods and services leads to reduced investments, reduction in the salaries of employees, and also increase unemployment. All these leads to massive reduction in the economic growth of the nation."
How to solve deflation?,"Some of the steps taken to solve the problem of deflation are cutting tax rates, reducing target interest rates, reducing the reserve limits of the banks, open market operations, quantitative easing, increasing expenditure by the Government.Deflation leads to decline in the economy. Quantitative easing means central banks purchasing the bonds of the Government by creating more money. This will help in increasing the supply of money by reducing bond yields. Open Market Operation (OMO) is the buying and selling of government securities in the open market by the Central Bank, i.e. Reserve Bank of India (RBI).RBI carries out the OMO through commercial banks and does not directly deal with the public. The major advantage of open market operations is that they inject money directly into the economy (or they extract money directly from it)."
"What is inflation, deflation, and stagflation?","The general rise in prices of goods and services is known as inflation. Moderate inflation is healthy for economic growth, but high inflation is not good for the economy. Deflation occurs when there is a huge decrease in prices of goods and services.Deflation is very bad for the economy because it will negatively impact the investments and production and thereby increase unemployment. When there is inflation but the economic growth is slow or stagnant and has a very high unemployment rate, then this is known as stagflation. Economists try to avoid both stagflation and deflation."
How does deflation affect borrowers and lenders?,"Borrowers who purchase assets will lose because, during deflation, assets lose their worth. During deflation, the lenders will not lend money as the interest rates will be low."
How can I check my PMJDY account?,"People can check their Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) account either through the website of the Public financial management system or by giving a missed call to a dedicated number.
